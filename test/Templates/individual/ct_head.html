 HEAD WITHOUT CONTRASTCLINICAL HISTORY: A 69-year-old female with left 
gaze deviation and suspected new seizure or stroke. COMPARISON: __ 
non-contrast head CT study. TECHNIQUE: Sequential axial CT images taken 
from the skull base to the level of the vertex without the intravenous 
administration of contrast. FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute 
intracranial hemorrhage or significant mass effect. Ventricles and sulci
 are appropriate for the patient's stated age. No midline shift is 
noted. The gray-white matter differentiation is preserved. There are new
 focal calcifications in the right frontal lobe and anterior right 
parietal lobe (series 2, image #28 and #29, respectively). These 
findings are nonspecific and may represent small calcified granulomas, 
but they are not typical for neurocysticercosis. The visualized portions
 of the orbits appear normal. There is mucosal thickening within the 
bilateral sphenoid sinuses. Left middle ear effusion is present. A soft 
tissue density is seen within the bony right external auditory canal, 
which may represent cerumen. IMPRESSION: New focal calcifications in the
 right frontal lobe and anterior right parietal lobe, with uncertain 
etiology and clinical significance. Findings are nonspecific, and 
although neurocysticercosis could be considered, these calcifications 
are not typical. Left middle ear effusion. Soft tissue density within 
the bony right external auditory canal, which may represent cerumen. 
Given the clinical history of left gaze deviation and suspected new 
seizure or stroke, further evaluation with MRI may be helpful to rule 
out underlying ischemic or inflammatory changes that may not be apparent
 on non-contrast CT</td></tr>

 HEAD WITHOUT CONTRASTCLINICAL HISTORY: A 65-year-old male presenting 
with sudden onset of right-sided weakness and slurred speech. 
COMPARISON: __. TECHNIQUE: Sequential axial CT images were acquired from
 the skull base to the vertex without the intravenous administration of 
contrast. FINDINGS: There is evidence of an acute left middle cerebral 
artery (MCA) territory infarct, with hypodensity involving the left 
frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes. There is effacement of the left 
lateral ventricle and sulci, consistent with cytotoxic edema. No 
hemorrhagic transformation is identified within the infarcted area. The 
left MCA is not clearly visualized, suggesting possible occlusion. There
 is a mild mass effect with approximately 4 mm of midline shift to the 
right. The basal cisterns remain patent. No acute extraaxial fluid 
collections or significant intracranial hemorrhage are observed. The 
ventricular system is otherwise unremarkable. Gray-white matter 
differentiation is preserved in the remaining cerebral parenchyma. 
Visualized portions of the orbits and paranasal sinuses are 
unremarkable. No significant mastoid air cell opacification is noted. 
IMPRESSION: Acute left MCA territory infarct with associated cytotoxic 
edema and mass effect, causing approximately 4 mm of midline shift to 
the right. The left MCA is not clearly visualized, suggesting possible 
occlusion. No hemorrhagic transformation within the infarcted area. No 
significant sinus or mastoid disease. Given the acute infarct findings, 
immediate clinical evaluation and consideration for appropriate 
intervention, such as thrombolysis or mechanical thrombectomy, are 
recommended. Further assessment with a CT angiogram or MRI with MR 
angiography may be useful to evaluate the patency of the cerebral 
vasculature and confirm the extent of ischemic injury.</td></tr>

 HEAD WITHOUT CONTRASTCLINICAL HISTORY: A 52-year-old female presenting 
with progressive headaches, memory loss, and personality changes. 
COMPARISON: None available. TECHNIQUE: Sequential axial CT images were 
acquired from the skull base to the vertex without the intravenous 
administration of contrast. FINDINGS: There is a well-defined, hypodense
 lesion in the left frontal lobe measuring approximately 3.2 x 2.4 cm, 
with surrounding vasogenic edema causing effacement of the adjacent 
sulci and mild mass effect on the left lateral ventricle. No significant
 midline shift is present. The lesion demonstrates minimal heterogeneous
 enhancement following contrast administration. No acute intracranial 
hemorrhage, extraaxial fluid collections, or other mass lesions are 
observed. The ventricular system is otherwise unremarkable. Gray-white 
matter differentiation is preserved in the remaining cerebral 
parenchyma. Visualized portions of the orbits and paranasal sinuses are 
unremarkable. No significant mastoid air cell opacification is noted. 
IMPRESSION: Left frontal lobe hypodense lesion with surrounding 
vasogenic edema and mild mass effect on the left lateral ventricle. The 
lesion demonstrates minimal heterogeneous enhancement. Differential 
considerations include a neoplastic process, such as glioma or 
metastasis, or less likely, an abscess or other infectious/inflammatory 
process. No significant sinus or mastoid disease. Given the presence of 
the left frontal lobe lesion, further evaluation with MRI, including 
post-contrast sequences, is recommended for better characterization and 
to guide appropriate management. Clinical correlation and additional 
workup, such as serologic tests or biopsy, may be warranted depending on
 the MRI findings.</td></tr>

 HEAD WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRASTCLINICAL HISTORY: A 45-year-old male 
presenting with dizziness, vertigo, and ataxia for the past three weeks.
 COMPARISON: None available. TECHNIQUE: Sequential axial CT images were 
acquired from the skull base to the vertex before and after intravenous 
administration of 100 mL of Isovue 300 contrast agent. FINDINGS: There 
is a well-circumscribed, homogenously enhancing mass in the left 
cerebellopontine angle measuring approximately 2.5 x 2.2 cm. The mass is
 exerting mass effect on the adjacent cerebellar hemisphere and 
brainstem without causing significant midline shift or hydrocephalus. 
The mass appears to arise from the internal auditory canal, suggesting a
 vestibular schwannoma. The cerebral parenchyma demonstrates no evidence
 of acute infarction, intracranial hemorrhage, or extraaxial fluid 
collections. The ventricular system is normal in size and configuration.
 Gray-white matter differentiation is preserved. Visualized portions of 
the orbits and paranasal sinuses appear unremarkable. No significant 
mastoid air cell opacification is noted. IMPRESSION: Left

 HEAD WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRASTCLINICAL HISTORY: A 60-year-old female 
with recent onset of headaches and blurry vision. COMPARISON: None 
available. TECHNIQUE: Sequential axial CT images were acquired from the 
skull base to the vertex before and after intravenous administration of 
100 mL of Isovue 300 contrast agent. FINDINGS: There is an enhancing 
mass centered in the sellar and suprasellar region measuring 
approximately 3.2 x 2.8 x 3.1 cm. The mass is compressing the optic 
chiasm superiorly, and extends into the cavernous sinuses bilaterally. 
The pituitary gland is not clearly identifiable, suggesting the mass may
 originate from the gland itself. The mass is most consistent with a 
pituitary macroadenoma. The cerebral parenchyma demonstrates no evidence
 of acute infarction, intracranial hemorrhage, or extraaxial fluid 
collections. The ventricular system is normal in size and configuration.
 Gray-white matter differentiation is preserved. Visualized portions of 
the orbits and paranasal sinuses appear unremarkable. No significant

 HEAD WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRASTCLINICAL HISTORY: A 55-year-old male 
presenting with progressive confusion, ataxia, and visual disturbances 
over the past several weeks. COMPARISON: None available. TECHNIQUE: 
Sequential axial CT images were acquired from the skull base to the 
vertex before and after intravenous administration of 100 mL of Isovue 
300 contrast agent. Coronal and sagittal reconstructions were also 
obtained. FINDINGS: A large, heterogeneously enhancing mass is 
identified in the left occipital lobe, measuring approximately 4.5 x 4.0
 x 3.8 cm. The mass is associated with significant perilesional 
vasogenic edema, causing mass effect on the adjacent left lateral 
ventricle, as well as a 6 mm left-to-right midline shift. There is no 
evidence of uncal or tonsillar herniation at this time. Multiple smaller
 enhancing lesions are seen scattered throughout both cerebral 
hemispheres, suggestive of a multifocal process. No acute intracranial 
hemorrhage is identified. The ventricular system appears mildly dilated,
 likely due to mass effect and the obstructive nature of the left 
occipital mass. The basal cisterns remain patent. The basal ganglia, 
thalami, and brainstem appear normal. The visualized orbits and 
paranasal sinuses show no significant abnormalities. The mastoid air 
cells are clear. IMPRESSION: Large, heterogeneously enhancing left 
occipital mass with surrounding vasogenic edema, mass effect on the 
adjacent left lateral ventricle, and a 6 mm left-to-right midline shift.
 In the context of the patient's clinical presentation, a high-grade 
primary brain neoplasm, such as glioblastoma, is the most likely 
etiology. Multiple smaller enhancing lesions scattered throughout both 
cerebral hemispheres, raising concern for a multifocal process. The 
differential diagnosis includes metastatic disease, multifocal glioma, 
or less likely, demyelinating disease. Mild ventriculomegaly, likely 
secondary to mass effect and obstruction by the left occipital mass.</td></tr>

 HEAD WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRASTCLINICAL HISTORY: A 43-year-old female 
with a history of HIV/AIDS presenting with recent onset of headache, 
fever, and behavioral changes. COMPARISON: None available. TECHNIQUE: 
Sequential axial CT images were acquired from the skull base to the 
vertex before and after intravenous administration of 100 mL of Isovue 
300 contrast agent. Coronal and sagittal reconstructions were also 
obtained. FINDINGS: Multiple ring-enhancing lesions are identified in 
the bilateral cerebral hemispheres, with the largest measuring 
approximately 2.5 x 2.0 x 1.8 cm in the right parietal lobe. These 
lesions are associated with mild surrounding vasogenic edema and 
localized mass effect but without significant midline shift or 
herniation. The largest lesion demonstrates a central hypodensity, 
suggestive of necrosis. No acute intracranial hemorrhage is detected. 
The basal ganglia, thalami, and brainstem appear normal. No abnormal 
enhancement is noted in the meninges, and the ventricular system is 
within normal limits. The basal cisterns are patent. The visualized 
orbits and paranasal sinuses show no significant abnormalities. The 
mastoid air cells are clear. IMPRESSION: Multiple bilateral cerebral 
ring-enhancing lesions with surrounding vasogenic edema and localized 
mass effect, most consistent with cerebral toxoplasmosis given the

opportunistic infections or metastatic disease; however, toxoplasmosis 
is favored in this clinical context. No evidence of significant midline

 HEAD WITHOUT CONTRASTCLINICAL HISTORY: A 45-year-old female with a 
history of intermittent blurred vision and left-sided weakness, 
suspected multiple sclerosis. COMPARISON: None available. TECHNIQUE: 
Sequential axial CT images were acquired from the skull base to the

 and sagittal reconstructions were also obtained. FINDINGS: There are 
scattered areas of hypodensity involving the periventricular white 
matter bilaterally, more pronounced in the left parietal lobe and right 
frontal lobe. Some of these lesions are oriented perpendicular to the 
lateral ventricles, suggesting a possible "Dawson's finger" pattern. 
However, the CT examination is suboptimal for evaluating demyelinating 
plaques, and there is no abnormal enhancement detected without 
administration of contrast. No significant mass effect, midline shift, 
or intracranial hemorrhage is noted. The ventricular system and basal 
cisterns are within normal limits. The brainstem, cerebellum, and basal 
ganglia show no abnormalities. No hydrocephalus or extra-axial fluid 
collections are seen. The visualized orbits appear normal. The paranasal
 sinuses demonstrate mild mucosal thickening, most likely representing 
sinusitis. The mastoid air cells are clear. IMPRESSION: Scattered 
bilateral periventricular white matter hypodensities, which may 
represent demyelinating plaques in the clinical context of suspected 
multiple sclerosis. However, the CT examination is limited in its 
evaluation of demyelinating disease and lacks the sensitivity of MRI.</td></tr>

 HEAD WITHOUT CONTRASTCLINICAL HISTORY: A 36-year-old male presenting 
with confusion and headache after a motor vehicle accident. COMPARISON: 
None available. TECHNIQUE: Sequential axial CT images were acquired from
 the skull base to the vertex without the intravenous administration of 
contrast agent. Coronal and sagittal reconstructions were also obtained.
 FINDINGS: There is a non-displaced fracture involving the left temporal
 bone, extending to the left mastoid process. No other skull fractures 
are identified. A small focus of hyperdensity is noted in the left 
temporal lobe, which may represent a small contusion or hemorrhage. No 
evidence of herniation, midline shift, or mass effect is observed. There
 are no signs of intracerebral, subarachnoid, or subdural hemorrhage. No
 acute ischemic changes are identified. A small left-sided epidural 
hematoma is seen, measuring approximately 6mm in thickness. No other 
extra-axial fluid collections are observed. The ventricular system is 
within normal limits, and the basal cisterns are patent. No orbital 
fractures or significant soft tissue swelling are identified. There is 
opacification of the left mastoid air cells, likely related to the 
fracture. The paranasal sinuses are clear. The upper cervical spine is 
visualized without significant degenerative changes or fractures. 
Further evaluation of the cervical spine would require dedicated 
imaging. IMPRESSION: Non-displaced fracture involving the left temporal 
bone, extending to the left mastoid process, with associated 
opacification of the left mastoid air cells. Small left-sided epidural 
hematoma measuring approximately 6mm in thickness. Small focus of 
hyperdensity in the left temporal lobe, which may represent a contusion 
or hemorrhage. </td></tr>
