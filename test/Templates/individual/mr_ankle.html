 MRI: MRI OF THE RIGHT ANKLE WITHOUT CONTRAST EXAM DATE: __ HISTORY: 
30-year-old male with right ankle pain and swelling following a sports 
injury. COMPARISON: None TECHNIQUE: T1, T2, and PD-FS sequences were 
performed of the right ankle in multiple planes. FINDINGS: There is a 
marker placed over the area of concern along the lateral aspect of the 
right ankle. The distal fibula appears intact with no evidence of 
fracture. The anterior talofibular ligament, calcaneofibular ligament, 
and posterior talofibular ligament are intact, with no evidence of 
tearing or significant thickening. A small tibiotalar joint effusion is 
present, along with surrounding soft tissue edema. No evidence of 
cartilage defects or osteochondral lesions within the talar dome. The 
peroneus longus and brevis tendons appear within normal limits, with no 
evidence of tendinopathy or tear. The flexor tendons and extensor 
tendons are intact and unremarkable. The Achilles tendon demonstrates 
normal signal, course, and caliber without evidence of tendinopathy or 
tear. The plantar aponeurosis is unremarkable. There is mild 
subcutaneous soft tissue edema around the lateral malleolus, likely 
secondary to the recent injury. The osseous structures are otherwise 
unremarkable, with no evidence of focal bone marrow edema or occult 
fracture. IMPRESSION: Intact ligaments of the right ankle with no 
evidence of tearing. Small tibiotalar joint effusion with surrounding 
soft tissue edema, likely related to the recent injury. Mild 
subcutaneous soft tissue edema around the lateral malleolus. Achilles 
tendon and plantar aponeurosis within normal limits. No evidence of 
fracture or bone marrow edema.</td></tr>

 MRI: MRI OF THE RIGHT ANKLE WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST EXAM DATE: __ 
HISTORY: Gradual onset of pain and swelling in the right ankle. Prior 
diagnosis of tenosynovial giant cell tumor. Further evaluation. 
TECHNIQUE: MR examination of the right ankle was performed using the 
following sequences: Axial T1, T2, and STIR; sagittal T1 and STIR; 
coronal T1 and STIR. In addition, 18 ml gadolinium was injected, and 
postcontrast T1 sagittal, coronal, and axial images were obtained. 
COMPARISON: None. FINDINGS: A marker was placed over the area of 
concern. In the region of the peroneal tendons, approximately 3-4 cm 
from the right ankle, there is a lobulated soft tissue mass measuring 
approximately 18 mm in AP dimension, 22 mm in transverse dimension, and 
24 mm in craniocaudal dimension. The signal intensity is intermediate on
 T1 and heterogeneously hyperintense on the STIR images. This appears to
 be located adjacent to the peroneal tendons. Following administration 
of contrast, heterogeneous enhancement is seen. Some venous 
prominence/engorgement noted inferior to the mass. The adjacent peroneal
 tendons are slightly displaced medially. Achilles tendon is intact. No 
surrounding inflammatory change seen. Remainder of examination otherwise
 unremarkable. Bone marrow signal of the adjacent tibia and fibula 
intact. Ligaments and tendons otherwise unremarkable. Flexor and 
extensor tendons normal. Lateral and medial ligaments are normal. 
IMPRESSION: There is a lobulated soft tissue mass measuring 18 x 22 x 24
 mm in the region of the peroneal tendons, approximately 3-4 cm from the
 right ankle joint. Heterogeneous enhancement seen following 
administration of contrast. Findings are suggestive of a tenosynovial 
giant cell tumor. Alternative diagnoses such as synovial sarcoma or 
benign soft tissue tumor are considered less likely. Otherwise, 
unremarkable exam. The adjacent bones and tendons are intact.</td></tr>

 MRI: MRI OF THE RIGHT ANKLE WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRASTEXAM DATE: 
__HISTORY: 60-year-old female with right ankle pain and suspicion of 
tarsal tunnel syndrome. COMPARISON: None. TECHNIQUE: T1 pre- and 
postcontrast and STIR sequences were performed of the right foot and 
ankle in multiple planes. A total of 16 ml of gadolinium contrast was 
intravenously administered. FINDINGS: Mild edema is present in the soft 
tissues surrounding the right ankle, predominantly in the tarsal tunnel 
region. No abnormal soft tissue fluid collection or abscess formation 
could be identified. The signal characteristics throughout the bony 
marrow are unremarkable without any suggestion for osteomyelitis. The 
flexor retinaculum appears thickened and there is flattening of the 
posterior tibial nerve in the tarsal tunnel, consistent with tarsal 
tunnel syndrome. The flexor and extensor tendons are within normal 
limits. The anterior and posterior inferior tibiofibular, the anterior 
and posterior talofibular, and calcaneofibular ligaments are intact. The
 plantar aponeurosis is within normal limits. The sinus tarsi are 
unremarkable. IMPRESSION: Mild edema is present in the soft tissues 
surrounding the right ankle, predominantly in the tarsal tunnel region. 
No abnormal soft tissue fluid collection or abscess formation could be 
identified. Thickening of the flexor retinaculum and flattening of the 
posterior tibial nerve in the tarsal tunnel, consistent with tarsal
