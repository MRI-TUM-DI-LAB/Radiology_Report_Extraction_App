 HISTORY: A 45-year-old female patient presents with a history of 
chronic right shoulder pain and recent trauma. COMPARISON: No previous 
imaging is available for comparison. TECHNIQUE: An MRI of the right 
shoulder was performed using a 1.5T magnet. Pre-and post-contrast 
multiplanar multi-sequence T1 and T2 weighted images were obtained 
before and after administration of 7 mL of Gadavist contrast material. 
FINDINGS: The study is of adequate quality without significant patient 
motion. Mild degenerative changes are observed within the 
acromioclavicular joint. There is no significant contact between the 
acromion and the humeral head. Minimal fluid is seen within the 
subacromial and subdeltoid bursa, and a small glenohumeral joint 
effusion is present. The rotator cuff tendons appear intact without 
evidence of tearing. The bicipital groove is of normal depth, and the 
biceps tendon appears intact. Evaluation of the labrum is limited by the
 lack of joint fluid, but there is no clear evidence of tearing. The 
articular cartilage of the humeral head and glenoid appears to be 
preserved, without significant irregularity. There are no areas of 
pathologic enhancement or bone marrow edema to suggest an acute fracture
 or metastatic disease. The visualized musculature and surrounding soft 
tissues are unremarkable. IMPRESSION: Mild degenerative changes in the 
acromioclavicular joint and minimal fluid in the subacromial and 
subdeltoid bursa. Small glenohumeral joint effusion. No evidence of 
rotator cuff tear, labral tear, or acute fracture. The study is 
otherwise unremarkable. I have personally reviewed the images for this 
examination and agree with the report transcribed above.45-year-old 
female presenting with left shoulder pain and stiffness, suspecting 
adhesive capsulitis.</td></tr>

 A 42-year-old female presents with shoulder pain. COMPARISON: None 
available. TECHNIQUE: A 3T MRI of the right shoulder was conducted, 
using a variety of sequences, including axial proton density with fat 
saturation, axial GRE, coronal proton density with fat saturation, 
coronal T2 with fat saturation, coronal T1, sagittal T2 with fat 
saturation, and sagittal T1. FINDINGS: The MRI reveals preserved 
articular cartilage and hematopoietic bone marrow. The acromioclavicular
 joint displays mild to moderate degenerative changes, with inferior 
joint capsule hypertrophy and enthesophytes causing mass effect on the 
underlying supraspinatus tendon. The coracoacromial ligament appears 
mildly thickened. Bone marrow edema is present within the clavicle, 
likely due to osteoarthritis, but may also be indicative of early distal
 clavicular osteolysis. A small amount of fluid and edema can be seen 
within the subacromial/subdeltoid bursa, which may suggest bursitis. No 
glenohumeral joint effusion is observed. Mild tendinopathy is present in
 the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and subscapularis tendons. The 
supraspinatus tendon also exhibits mild bursal-sided fraying. The teres 
minor tendon appears normal. The biceps tendon and anchor are intact. 
Evaluation of the labrum is limited due to lack of joint fluid. A tear 
of the superior labrum, posterosuperiorly, is identified. Incidentally 
noted are breast implants. IMPRESSION: Posterosuperior superior labral 
tear. Bone marrow edema in the clavicle, likely secondary to 
osteoarthritis but possibly due to early changes of distal clavicular 
osteolysis. Mild tendinopathy in the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and 
subscapularis tendons. Mild to moderate degenerative changes in the 
acromioclavicular joint.</td></tr>

 The patient is a 53-year-old female presenting with right shoulder 
pain, with a request to evaluate for synovitis. COMPARISON: No prior 
studies are available for comparison. TECHNIQUE: A 3T MRI of the right 
shoulder was performed, including axial, coronal, and sagittal sequences
 with proton density fat saturation and T1- and T2-weighted images. 
FINDINGS: The MRI reveals minimal degenerative changes in the 
acromioclavicular joint. There is a small amount of fluid in the 
subacromial subdeltoid bursa and a moderate-sized glenohumeral joint 
effusion with synovitis. Mild bursal-sided fraying and tendinopathy of 
the distal supraspinatus tendon are seen, with punctate T2 
hyperintensity at its insertion but no discrete tear. Mild tendinopathy 
of the subscapularis tendon is also noted. The remainder of the rotator 
cuff appears unremarkable. The intra-articular biceps tendon 
demonstrates minimal tendinopathy, while the extra-articular biceps 
tendon appears normal in location and appearance. A small paralabral 
cyst is adjacent to the anterosuperior labrum, measuring 5 x 3 x 2 mm, 
with associated tearing and partial detachment of the anterior and 
anteroinferior labrum. Mild degeneration of the posterior labrum is 
present as well. Mild subchondral cystic changes are seen in the 
anteroinferior glenoid, and minimal cystic change of the humeral head 
insertion of the interest in this tendon is observed. Linear signal 
subjacent to the superior humeral head cartilage, measuring 13 x 8 mm, 
is consistent with cartilage delamination. Cartilage thinning is also 
noted over the anteroinferior glenoid. No pathologically enlarged lymph 
nodes are identified, and muscle bulk and signal intensity appear within
 normal limits. IMPRESSION: Tearing and partial detachment of the 
anterior and inferior labrum with an adjacent small paralabral cyst. 
Cartilage delamination over the superior humeral head. Moderate 
glenohumeral joint effusion with synovitis.</td></tr>

 HISTORY: 56-year-old patient with right shoulder pain and limited range
 of motion, evaluate for adhesive capsulitis or rotator cuff tear. 
COMPARISON: Radiographs of the right shoulder dated __. PROCEDURE: On a 
1.5T magnet, the following MR sequences were obtained of the right 
shoulder: three-plane localizer, coronal T1, coronal T2 with fat 
saturation, sagittal T1, sagittal T2 with fat saturation, axial 
GRE/MERGE, and axial PD with fat saturation through the labrum.FINDINGS:
 Mild degenerative changes are seen in the acromioclavicular joint with 
slight capsular hypertrophy. No significant osteophytes are observed, 
and the coracoacromial ligament appears unremarkable. There is mild 
subacromial/subdeltoid bursitis, and a small glenohumeral joint effusion
 is noted without significant synovitis. In terms of the rotator cuff, 
the supraspinatus tendon shows mild tendinopathy with some undersurface 
fraying, but no full-thickness tear is present. The infraspinatus tendon
 demonstrates mild tendinopathy without any evidence of tearing. The 
subscapularis tendon exhibits mild tendinopathy as well, with no 
full-thickness defect. The teres minor tendon appears unremarkable. The 
long head of the biceps tendon is intact and appropriately positioned 
within the bicipital groove, with mild tenosynovitis. The 
intra-articular biceps tendon and anchor appear normal. Mild 
degenerative tearing is observed along the superior labrum, extending 
both anteriorly and posteriorly. Mild chondral thinning is seen in the 
glenohumeral joint, more pronounced on the humeral head and glenoid. 
There is no significant bone marrow edema or other signal abnormalities.
 IMPRESSION: Mild rotator cuff tendinopathy without full-thickness 
tears, mild degenerative changes in the acromioclavicular joint, mild 
subacromial/subdeltoid bursitis, and mild glenohumeral joint chondral 
thinning. No evidence of adhesive capsulitis is seen.</td></tr>

 were obtained of the right shoulder: three-plane localizer, coronal T1,
 coronal T2 with fat saturation, sagittal T1, sagittal T2 with fat 
saturation, axial PD with fat saturation through the labrum.FINDINGS: 
The acromioclavicular joint shows mild degenerative changes without 
significant mass effect on the subacromial space. The coracoacromial 
ligament appears normal. No significant subacromial/subdeltoid bursitis 
or glenohumeral joint effusion is observed. Rotator cuff tendons appear 
intact without evidence of tear or significant tendinopathy. The biceps 
tendon is normal, and the labrum appears grossly intact. No significant 
chondral wear or osteoarthritic changes are seen in the glenohumeral 
joint. There is a moderate thickening of the joint capsule and synovium,
 which is consistent with the clinical suspicion of adhesive capsulitis 
(frozen shoulder). The axillary recess demonstrates a mild fluid 
collection, likely due to synovial inflammation.IMPRESSION: MRI findings
 are consistent with adhesive capsulitis, also known as frozen shoulder.
 There is no evidence of rotator cuff tear or significant glenohumeral 
joint osteoarthritis.</td></tr>
