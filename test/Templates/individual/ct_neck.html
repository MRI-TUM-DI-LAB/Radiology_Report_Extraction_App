 MRI NECK WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRASTCLINICAL HISTORY: Male, 45 years of 
age, presenting with a history of persistent hoarseness and suspicion of
 laryngeal pathology. COMPARISON: None. TECHNIQUE: MRI of the neck was 
performed using pre- and post-contrast T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and 
STIR sequences in axial, coronal, and sagittal planes. Post-contrast 
imaging was obtained following intravenous administration of 9 mL of 
Gadavist. FINDINGS: The nasopharynx, oropharynx, and hypopharynx appear 
unremarkable without any evidence of mass or abnormal enhancement. The 
larynx demonstrates thickening and irregular enhancement involving the 
left true vocal cord, extending from the anterior commissure to the 
arytenoid cartilage. The lesion measures approximately 20 x 8 x 6 mm. 
There is no evidence of cartilage invasion or extension into the 
paraglottic space. Paranasal sinuses reveal mild mucosal thickening in 
the maxillary sinuses bilaterally, without opacification. The mastoid 
air cells and middle ear cavities are clear. The cervical spine is 
unremarkable, without fracture or malalignment. The lung apices are 
clear. Salivary glands and thyroid gland appear normal. No significant 
cervical lymphadenopathy is identified. The largest lymph node, at the 
left level III, measures 9 x 5 mm. The arteries and veins of the neck 
are unremarkable. IMPRESSION: Thickening and irregular enhancement 
involving the left true vocal cord, measuring approximately 20 x 8 x 6 
mm, suspicious for laryngeal neoplasm. Direct laryngoscopy and biopsy 
are recommended for further evaluation. Mild mucosal thickening in 
bilateral maxillary sinuses, likely inflammatory. No significant 
cervical lymphadenopathy or vascular abnormalities.</td></tr>

 MRI NECK WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRASTCLINICAL HISTORY: Male, 54 years of 
age, presenting with a three-month history of progressive dysphagia and 
left-sided neck mass. COMPARISON: __. TECHNIQUE: Contrast-enhanced CT of
 the neck was obtained in the axial plane after administration of 40 mL 
of IV contrast, with coronal and sagittal reformats. The estimated 
cumulative exposure (DLP mGy/cm) is 221. FINDINGS: The left maxillary 
sinus demonstrates mild mucosal thickening. The remainder of the 
paranasal sinuses, mastoid air cells, and middle ear cavities are clear.
 There are no lytic or blastic lesions in the bones. The cervical spine 
is unremarkable without fracture or malalignment. The lung apices are 
clear. Salivary glands and thyroid gland are normal. A well-defined, 
heterogeneously enhancing mass is identified in the left level II 
region, measuring approximately 3.5 x 2.6 x 3.1 cm. The mass is 
inseparable from the left sternocleidomastoid muscle and appears to 
exert mass effect on the adjacent internal jugular vein. No evidence of 
vascular invasion is noted. No calcification or necrosis is seen within 
the mass. No pathologic lymphadenopathy is identified in the remaining 
neck or supraclavicular regions. The arteries and veins of the neck are 
otherwise unremarkable. IMPRESSION: Heterogeneously enhancing left level
 II neck mass measuring approximately 3.5 x 2.6 x 3.1 cm, inseparable 
from the left sternocleidomastoid muscle, and causing mass effect on the
 adjacent internal jugular vein. Further evaluation with tissue sampling
 is recommended to establish a definitive diagnosis. Mild mucosal 
thickening in the left maxillary sinus. No pathologic lymphadenopathy in
 the neck or supraclavicular regions.</td></tr>

 MRI NECK WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRASTCONTRAST HISTORY: 27-year-old man 
with a history of pharyngitis and persistent pain. Rule out 
retropharyngeal abscess or peritonsillar abscess. COMPARISON: None. 
TECHNIQUE: Sequential axial thin-section CT images were taken from the 
skull base down to the level of the thoracic inlet after the uneventful 
intravenous administration of 75 mL of Ultravist 370 contrast agent. 
Additional sagittal and coronal reformatted images were then produced. 
The estimated cumulative exposure (DLP mGy/cm) is 324.53. FINDINGS: 
Numerous bilateral lymphadenopathy is seen at the internal jugular lymph
 node stations. The largest right level 2A lymph node measures 1.6 x 1.6
 cm, and the largest left level 2A lymph node measures 1.6 x 1.8 cm. A 
left level 5 lymph node measures 1 x 0.9 cm, with an adjacent left level
 4/5 lymph node measuring 1 x 1 x 0.9 cm. The bilateral palatine tonsils
 are enlarged and appear heterogeneous. No peripherally enhancing fluid 
collection suggestive of a tonsillar abscess is noted. The 
retropharyngeal space is without fluid collection. The right piriform 
sinus appears effaced due to fluid or debris. The parotid, 
submandibular, and thyroid glands are unremarkable. The adenoid tonsils 
are likely within normal limits for age. The nasopharynx, oropharynx, 
hypopharynx, larynx, subglottic trachea, epiglottis, and aryepiglottic 
folds are unremarkable. The trachea is patent. No prevertebral soft 
tissue swelling is seen. The bilateral jugular veins are patent. The 
visualized portions of the brain, orbits, paranasal sinuses, and mastoid
 air cells appear unremarkable. The visualized portions of the lung 
apices are clear. IMPRESSION: Enlarged and heterogeneous bilateral 
palatine tonsils with associated bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy as 
detailed above. Findings are most consistent with an 
infectious/inflammatory process. No drainable abscess is identified.</td></tr>

 MRI NECK WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRASTHISTORY: 55-year-old male presents 
with progressive dysphagia and weight loss. Evaluate for neoplastic 
process. COMPARISON: None. TECHNIQUE: Contrast-enhanced CT of the neck 
was performed after administration of 90mL of Isovue 300. Sequential 
axial thin-section images were obtained from the skull base to the 
thoracic inlet. Coronal and sagittal reformats were produced. The 
estimated cumulative dose (DLP [mGy-cm]) is: 331. FINDINGS: There is a 
circumferential, enhancing, and irregular mass centered in the 
hypopharynx and proximal esophagus, measuring approximately 4.5 cm in 
craniocaudal dimension and causing near-complete luminal narrowing. This
 mass extends from the level of the aryepiglottic folds to the level of 
the upper esophagus. Multiple enlarged, enhancing lymph nodes are noted 
in the bilateral neck. The largest right level 3 lymph node measures 2.1
 x 1.4 cm, and the largest left level 3 lymph node measures 2.0 x 1.6 
cm. The nasopharynx, oropharynx, and larynx are otherwise unremarkable. 
The trachea is patent. There is no prevertebral soft tissue swelling. 
Bilateral jugular veins are patent. Visualized portions of the brain, 
orbits, paranasal sinuses, and mastoid air cells are unremarkable. The 
visualized lung apices are clear. IMPRESSION: Circumferential, 
enhancing, irregular mass centered in the hypopharynx and proximal 
esophagus causing near-complete luminal narrowing, concerning for 
neoplastic process. Multiple enlarged, enhancing lymph nodes in the 
bilateral neck, suspicious for metastatic involvement.</td></tr>

 MRI NECK WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRASTCLINICAL HISTORY: 70 year old male 
with metastatic lung cancer. COMPARISON: PET/CT __. TECHNIQUE: CT neck 
was performed following administration of 35 mL IV contrast. The 
estimated cumulative dose (DLP [mGy-cm]) is 209.FINDINGS: The soft 
tissues of the neck appear unremarkable. The nasopharynx, oropharynx, 
hypopharynx, and trachea show no abnormalities, aside from right vocal 
cord paralysis. There is mild scattered mucosal thickening in the 
paranasal sinuses and small bilateral mastoid effusions. The major 
salivary glands appear normal. However, infiltration of the right 
thyroid lobe by adjacent adenopathy is noted. Significant 
lymphadenopathy is observed in the neck, including a conglomerate right 
level III/IV and supraclavicular lymph node on series 301, image 40, 
measuring at least 4.4 x 3.7 cm. This has enlarged since the prior exam.
 On the left side, a level III/IV and supraclavicular lymph node 
conglomerate is seen on series 301, image 49, measuring at least 3.8 x 
3.6 cm. Additionally, prominent and clustered left level V lymph nodes 
are visible on series 301, image 61. The right lower 
cervical/supraclavicular conglomerate nodal mass compresses or involves 
the right internal jugular vein and encases the proximal right common 
carotid artery and right vertebral artery. Mild multilevel degenerative 
changes are present in the cervical spine. The patient has a history of 
left posterior occipital craniotomy, and ossification of the posterior 
longitudinal ligament is observed at C3-4-5-6. The lung apices reveal no
 significant abnormalities, and the right paratracheal lymphadenopathy 
infiltrates the inferior aspect of the right thyroid lobe. Further 
evaluation of intrathoracic findings should be done with a dedicated CT 
chest examination. The visualized brain parenchyma shows evidence of 
status post left posterior parietal craniotomy without enhancement in 
the underlying brain. IMPRESSION: Bilateral cervical and supraclavicular
 lymphadenopathy showing progression of nodal metastatic disease. 
Compression and possible invasion of the right internal jugular vein by 
right cervical adenopathy, encasement of the proximal right common 
carotid artery, and proximal right vertebral artery. Increasing 
infiltration of the right inferior thyroid lobe by adjacent adenopathy.</td></tr>
