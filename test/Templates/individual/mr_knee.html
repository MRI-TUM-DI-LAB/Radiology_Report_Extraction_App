 MRI KNEE RIGHT WITHOUT CONTRAST EXAM DATE: __ HISTORY: The patient 
presents with right knee pain and has a history of medial meniscal 
repair in December 2011. The evaluation aims to assess for potential 
cartilage abnormalities or issues related to the prior surgery. 
TECHNIQUE: The MRI examination of the right knee utilized coronal PD, 
sagittal T1, sagittal T2, axial T2, and coronal T2 FS sequences. 
COMPARISON: __. FINDINGS: The MRI reveals the patella to be properly 
aligned with the trochlear groove, showing no evidence of subluxation or
 maltracking. A moderate joint effusion is observed, indicating an 
improvement compared to the prior examination. Chondromalacia is not 
detected, and no loose bodies are present. In terms of ligaments and 
tendons, the quadriceps and patellar tendons appear intact and 
unremarkable. The anterior cruciate ligament, posterior cruciate 
ligament, and medial and lateral collateral ligaments also show no 
abnormalities or signs of injury. Regarding the menisci, the medial 
meniscus reveals a degenerative tear in the body and anterior horn, 
while the lateral meniscus shows mild fraying along the free edge of the
 posterior horn. There is no evidence of a recurrent or new tear in the 
lateral meniscus. The examination of cartilaginous and osseous 
structures demonstrates moderate thinning of the articular cartilage in 
both the medial and lateral compartments, suggesting progressive 
degenerative changes. The bone marrow signal of the distal femur, 
proximal tibia, and fibula appears normal, with no indication of stress 
fractures or subchondral edema. A moderate-sized Baker's cyst is 
identified in the posteromedial aspect of the knee joint, measuring 
approximately 2.5 cm in size. IMPRESSION: Moderate joint effusion, 
improved compared to prior examination. Degenerative tear in the body 
and anterior horn of the medial meniscus. Mild fraying in the posterior

posterior cruciate ligaments are intact and normal in appearance. The 
medial and lateral collateral ligaments appear intact. The popliteus 
tendon and posterolateral corner structures are also intact. The 
quadriceps and patellar tendons are unremarkable, with no evidence of 
tendinopathy or tear. Hoffa's fat pad signal intensity is within normal 
limits. The articular cartilage of the medial and lateral compartments 
appears preserved. There is mild patellofemoral compartment cartilage 
signal heterogeneity, but no full-thickness chondral defect is 
identified. Bone marrow signal intensity is within normal limits. No 
Baker's cyst or pes anserine bursitis is identified. The visualized 
neurovascular structures appear unremarkable. IMPRESSION: Complex tear 
of the lateral meniscus involving the body and posterior horn with a 
displaced fragment in the intercondylar notch. Mild left knee joint 
effusion. Intact ligaments and tendons.</td></tr>

 MRI of the right knee HISTORY Patient slipped on ice two weeks ago. 
TECHNIQUE: Sagittal proton density, T2-weighted, coronal proton density 
fat-saturated, and T2-weighted images, as well as axial proton density 
fat-saturated images are evaluated. FINDINGS: There is a complex tear of
 the posterior horn of the medial meniscus extending to the 
meniscocapsular junction. The anterior horn of the medial meniscus is 
unremarkable. The lateral meniscus appears intact without any evidence 
of tear. The T2-weighted images demonstrate a mild bone marrow edema 
involving the lateral femoral condyle and lateral tibial plateau. No 
evidence of fracture or cortical disruption is observed. The anterior 
cruciate ligament, posterior cruciate ligament, patellar tendon, and 
quadriceps tendon are intact and appear normal. The medial and lateral 
patellar retinacula, as well as the medial and lateral patellofemoral 
ligaments, are intact. The patellar and trochlear cartilage appears 
preserved. The posterolateral capsular structures, including the arcuate
 popliteal ligament and popliteus tendon, are unremarkable. The biceps 
femoris appears intact. No significant muscular signal abnormality is 
detected. The iliotibial band, fibular collateral ligament, and medial 
collateral ligaments are intact. IMPRESSION: Complex tear of the 
posterior horn of the medial meniscus with meniscocapsular junction 
involvement. Mild bone marrow edema involving the lateral femoral 
condyle and lateral tibial plateau, consistent with bone contusion. No 
fracture or cortical disruption identified. Intact cruciate ligaments, 
patellar tendon, and quadriceps tendon. Unremarkable posterolateral 
capsular structures and collateral ligaments. Lateral meniscus is 
intact.</td></tr>
