 HISTORY: Left wrist pain. TECHNIQUE: Neutral sitting, axial T1, axial 
T2, coronal T1, coronal T2, coronal STIR, sagittal T2. FINDINGS: There 
is no evidence of fracture or abnormal bone marrow edema. No suspicious 
bone lesions are observed. A slight negative ulnar variance is present. 
The triangular fibrocartilage complex near the radial attachment remains
 intact, and both scapholunate and lunotriquetral ligaments are 
preserved. The flexor and extensor tendons around the wrist appear 
normal. A moderate joint effusion is seen in the radiocarpal joint, 
accompanied by a 1.0 x 0.8 x 0.3 cm cystic structure on the volar aspect
 of the radiocarpal joint, likely indicative of a synovial cyst. A 4 mm 
cystic structure is located dorsally to the lunate-capitate joint and 
may represent a small ganglion cyst or synovial cyst. Osteoarthritic 
changes can be seen in the second carpometacarpal joint, including joint
 space narrowing, small marginal osteophytes, and mild joint effusion. 
No soft tissue masses are detected. Both the median and ulnar nerves 
appear unremarkable, and the carpal tunnel remains intact. A lobulated 
cystic structure measuring 2.0 x 1.0 x 0.4 cm is present on the volar 
aspect of the fourth and fifth carpometacarpal joints, possibly 
representing a ganglion cyst or synovial cyst.IMPRESSION: Slight 
negative ulnar variance without associated TFCC tear. Osteoarthritic 
changes in the second carpometacarpal joint with mild joint effusion. 
Moderate joint effusion in the radiocarpal joint with synovial cyst 
volar to the radiocarpal joint. A 4 mm cyst dorsal to the 
lunate-capitate joint, which may represent a small ganglion cyst or 
synovial cyst. A 2.0 x 1.0 x 0.4 cm lobulated cystic structure volar to 
the fourth and fifth carpometacarpal joints, which may represent a 
ganglion cyst or synovial cyst.</td></tr>

 MRI RIGHT WRIST WITHOUT CONTRAST EXAM DATE: __ CLINICAL HISTORY: Right 
wrist pain. COMPARISON: None available. TECHNIQUE: MRI of the right 
wrist was performed using 1.5 Tesla magnet. Multiplanar proton density, 
T1-weighted, and T2-weighted fat-suppressed sequences were obtained. 
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of fracture, dislocation, or abnormal 
bone marrow signal. The alignment of the carpal bones is normal. No 
significant ulnar variance is observed. The triangular fibrocartilage 
complex is intact, as are the scapholunate and lunotriquetral ligaments.
 The extensor and flexor tendons appear normal. A focal area of 
increased signal intensity is noted within the proximal aspect of the 
scaphoid bone, consistent with a bone contusion. Mild tenosynovitis is 
seen involving the extensor carpi ulnaris tendon sheath, likely 
secondary to overuse or strain. No joint effusion or ganglion cysts are 
identified. The surrounding soft tissues appear unremarkable. 
IMPRESSION: Bone contusion in the proximal aspect of the scaphoid bone. 
Mild tenosynovitis involving the extensor carpi ulnaris tendon sheath. 
No evidence of fracture, dislocation, or significant ligamentous injury.</td></tr>

 MRI LEFT WRIST WITHOUT CONTRAST EXAM DATE: __ CLINICAL HISTORY: 
24-year-old female, history of a fall on the outstretched left hand on 
12/03/2022, with subsequent left wrist pain and swelling. COMPARISON: 
Left wrist radiographs __ PROCEDURE COMMENTS: Multiplanar, multisequence
 imaging of the left wrist was performed at 3T without 
contrast.FINDINGS: The MRI reveals a mild effusion in the radiocarpal 
and midcarpal joints. A linear low signal intensity is observed 
traversing the waist of the scaphoid bone, consistent with an acute 
nondisplaced scaphoid fracture. Associated marrow edema is also present.
 There are no additional fractures or bone contusions identified. The 
scapholunate and lunotriquetral ligaments appear intact, and the carpal 
bones demonstrate normal alignment. The triangular fibrocartilage 
complex (TFCC) is intact, with no evidence of tears or degeneration. The
 ulnar attachments of the peripheral TFCC are preserved, and both the 
foveal attachment and the central articular disc are intact. No 
significant tenosynovitis or tendon tears are noted in the flexor or 
extensor compartments. The carpal tunnel and median nerve appear 
unremarkable. IMPRESSION: Acute nondisplaced scaphoid fracture with 
associated marrow edema. Mild effusion in the radiocarpal and midcarpal 
joints. Intact scapholunate and lunotriquetral ligaments and normal 
carpal bone alignment. Preserved triangular fibrocartilage complex with 
no tears or degeneration.</td></tr>

 LEFT WRIST WITHOUT CONTRAST EXAM DATE: __ CLINICAL HISTORY: A 
36-year-old female with complaints of left wrist pain, swelling, and 
limited range of motion. No known history of trauma or prior surgeries. 
TECHNIQUE: A comprehensive MRI of the left wrist was performed using a 
3T scanner without the administration of contrast. FINDINGS: No bone 
fractures or dislocations are observed. The bone marrow signal is within
 normal limits, and there are no suspicious bone lesions. Additionally, 
no significant bone marrow edema or osteochondral defects are 
identified. The scapholunate, lunotriquetral, and other intercarpal 
ligaments appear intact, with no evidence of tearing or disruptions. 
Furthermore, the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) is preserved, 
and no signs of tearing or degenerative changes are noted. The cartilage
 surfaces are well maintained, and there is no indication of 
degenerative changes. The joint spaces appear well preserved, and no 
significant joint effusion is seen in the radiocarpal, midcarpal, or 
distal radioulnar joints. The extensor tendons, including the extensor 
carpi radialis longus and brevis, extensor carpi ulnaris, and extensor 
digitorum, display no signs of tears or tendinopathy. Similarly, the 
flexor tendons, including the flexor carpi radialis, flexor carpi 
ulnaris, and flexor digitorum superficialis and profundus, also appear 
normal with no evidence of inflammation, tears, or tendon sheath 
thickening. The carpal tunnel region is unremarkable, with no evidence 
of compression or abnormality of the median nerve. The flexor 
retinaculum appears intact, and no significant tenosynovitis is 
identified. The median and ulnar nerves are well visualized, with no 
evidence of compression, swelling, or abnormal signal intensity. A small
 ganglion cyst measuring approximately 1.0 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm is identified 
on the dorsal aspect of the wrist, adjacent to the scapholunate 
ligament. This finding may be the cause of the patient's discomfort and 
limited range of motion. IMPRESSION: A small ganglion cyst on the dorsal
 aspect of the left wrist, adjacent to the scapholunate ligament. 
Otherwise unremarkable MRI of the left wrist with no evidence of 
fractures, ligamentous tears, or significant degenerative changes.</td></tr>
