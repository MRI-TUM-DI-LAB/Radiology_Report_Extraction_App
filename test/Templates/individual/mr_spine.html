 HISTORY: 56-year-old male with metastatic lung cancer. COMPARISON: CT 
chest, abdomen, and pelvis from __. TECHNIQUE: MRI of the cervical, 
thoracic, and lumbar spine was performed with and without IV contrast. 
Sequences include sagittal T1 with and without contrast, sagittal T2, 
sagittal STIR, axial T2, and axial T1 with contrast. 7 ml of intravenous
 Gadavist was injected. FINDINGS: Multiple osseous metastases are 
identified throughout the spine. The largest metastatic lesion is in the
 T12 vertebral body, with an associated soft tissue component extending 
into the epidural space, resulting in moderate spinal cord compression. 
The T12 vertebral body demonstrates near-complete collapse. Additional 
metastatic lesions are seen in the C5, C6, T5, T7, and L3 vertebral 
bodies, without significant spinal canal compromise or cord compression.
 No intrathecal metastases or abnormal leptomeningeal enhancement is 
identified. The conus medullaris terminates at the L1 level and appears 
unremarkable. There is no evidence of abnormal cord signal. Multilevel 
degenerative changes are noted in the lumbar spine with moderate to 
severe facet joint hypertrophy and associated mild bilateral foraminal 
narrowing at L4/L5 and L5/S1. The recent CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis 
demonstrates multiple pulmonary nodules, a large liver mass, and 
peritoneal nodules, consistent with metastatic disease.IMPRESSION: 
Multiple osseous metastases throughout the spine, with significant 
spinal cord compression at the T12 level due to the associated epidural 
soft tissue component. The patient may benefit from further evaluation 
and management, including possible surgical intervention. Additional 
osseous metastases in the C5, C6, T5, T7, and L3 vertebral bodies, 
without significant spinal canal compromise or cord compression. 
Multilevel degenerative changes in the lumbar spine with moderate to 
severe facet joint hypertrophy and mild bilateral foraminal narrowing at
 L4/L5 and L5/S1. Findings consistent with metastatic lung cancer, as 
better described on the recent CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis.</td></tr>

focal lesions or abnormal enhancement is observed. Intervertebral discs 
demonstrate age-appropriate degenerative changes. The cervical spinal 
cord is unremarkable in signal intensity and caliber. There is no 
significant foraminal narrowing or spinal canal stenosis. Thoracic 
Spine: The thoracic vertebrae show normal signal intensity, and no focal

 HISTORY: 45-year-old female presenting with chronic back pain and a 
history of rheumatoid arthritis. Assess for any degenerative changes. 
COMPARISON: None. TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar, multisequence MRI of the 
cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine performed using a 3 Tesla scanner. 
Pre- and post-contrast images were obtained after administering 7 mL of 
Gadavist. The following sequences were used: sagittal T1, sagittal T2, 
sagittal STIR, axial T1, axial T2, and post-contrast axial and sagittal 
T1-weighted sequences with fat saturation. FINDINGS: The vertebral 
alignment throughout the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine is 
maintained. No evidence of abnormal bone marrow signal or infiltration 
is noted in the visualized vertebral bodies. In the cervical spine, 
there is mild multilevel degenerative disc disease with disc desiccation
 and small anterior osteophytes at C4-C5, C5-C6, and C6-C7 levels. No 
significant spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis is seen in the 
cervical spine. No cord signal abnormality is identified. The thoracic 
spine demonstrates mild degenerative changes with Schmorl's nodes at 
T6-T7 and T8-T9 levels. No significant spinal canal or neural foraminal 
stenosis is seen. No cord signal abnormality is present. In the lumbar 
spine, there is moderate degenerative disc disease with disc 
desiccation, disc space narrowing, and moderate-sized anterior 
osteophytes at L4-L5 and L5-S1 levels. Mild spinal canal stenosis is 
noted at L4-L5, predominantly due to ligamentum flavum hypertrophy and 
facet joint arthropathy. No significant neural foraminal stenosis is 
identified. Paraspinal and prevertebral soft tissues appear 
unremarkable. No abnormal enhancing lesions or masses are seen. The 
conus medullaris terminates at the T12-L1 level and appears normal in

 HISTORY: A 63-year-old female presents with progressive back pain, 
bilateral lower extremity numbness, and weakness. The purpose of this 
examination is to assess for potential spinal pathology. COMPARISON: 
None. PROCEDURE: An MRI of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine was 
performed before and after administration of 8 mL IV Gadavist contrast 
at 3 Tesla. Sagittal T2, STIR, T1, axial T2, and postcontrast axial and 
sagittal T1 sequences were obtained. FINDINGS: The alignment of the 
spine is normal. Diffuse degenerative changes are seen throughout the 
cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine, with disc desiccation, disc space 
narrowing, and osteophyte formation. Multilevel Schmorl's nodes are 
observed, particularly in the thoracic spine. A focal area of abnormal 
signal intensity and enhancement is noted within the T9 vertebral body, 
suspicious for an infiltrative lesion. This lesion causes moderate 
spinal canal stenosis and mild compression of the spinal cord without 
cord signal abnormality. Adjacent to the T9 lesion, there is a mild 
anterolisthesis of T8 on T9, causing additional spinal canal narrowing. 
The spinal cord and conus medullaris appear normal without any signal 
abnormalities or enhancement, apart from the mild compression at the T9 
level. Moderate to severe bilateral neural foraminal stenosis is 
observed at multiple levels in the cervical spine, secondary to a 
combination of uncovertebral joint hypertrophy, facet joint arthropathy,
 and disc bulges. The visualized extra-vertebral soft tissues appear 
unremarkable, and no abnormal enhancement is noted. IMPRESSION: Focal 
lesion within the T9 vertebral body, suspicious for an infiltrative 
process such as metastasis or infection, causing moderate spinal canal 
stenosis and mild compression of the spinal cord. Further evaluation 
with additional imaging or biopsy is recommended. Multilevel 
degenerative changes throughout the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar 
spine, with moderate to severe bilateral neural foraminal stenosis at 
multiple cervical levels. Mild anterolisthesis of T8 on T9, contributing
 to spinal canal narrowing. No other significant spinal canal or neural 
foraminal stenosis.</td></tr>
