 CT ABDOMEN/PELVISCLINICAL HISTORY: Male patient presenting with 
abdominal pain and unexplained weight loss.TECHNIQUE: Axial CT images of
 the abdomen and pelvis were obtained after administering oral contrast 
material.  FINDINGS: The liver appears normal in size and attenuation, 
with no focal lesions or biliary ductal dilatation detected. The 
gallbladder contains multiple gallstones, but there are no signs of 
cholecystitis or wall thickening.  The spleen, pancreas, and adrenal 
glands are unremarkable, showing no evidence of masses, inflammation, or
 abnormalities. A moderate-sized, reducible umbilical hernia is noted.  
Both kidneys are within normal limits in terms of size and 
configuration. No renal or ureteral stones are present, and there is no 
hydroureter or hydronephrosis.  The appendix is not visualized, and 
there is no periappendiceal fat stranding. Diverticulosis is observed in
 the sigmoid colon, but no signs of acute diverticulitis are present. No
 bowel obstruction or significant bowel wall thickening is detected.  No
 abdominal ascites or lymphadenopathy is identified in the peritoneal 
cavity. The bladder appears unremarkable, with no intrinsic or extrinsic
 masses. The prostate gland is grossly unremarkable, and no pelvic 
ascites or lymphadenopathy is observed.  Images of the lung bases reveal
 no pleural or parenchymal masses or pleural effusions. There are mild 
degenerative changes in the lumbar spine but no acute findings.  
IMPRESSION: Multiple gallstones without signs of acute cholecystitis. 
Diverticulosis in the sigmoid colon without acute diverticulitis. 
Moderate-sized, reducible umbilical hernia. Mild degenerative changes in
 the lumbar spine.</td></tr>

ENHANCED CT ABDOMEN/PELVISCLINICAL HISTORY: LLQ pain. TECHNIQUE: 
Multiple axial and coronal CT images were obtained through the abdomen 
and pelvis after administration of oral and intravenous contrast 
material. COMPARISON: Prior CT of the abdomen and pelvis report dated 
__. FINDINGS: 4.0 cm hypodense lesion in the left hepatic lobe. The 
lesion is noted to have subtle enhancement during the arterial phase and
 washout on delayed phase. Differential includes hepatic hemangioma or 
focal nodular hyperplasia, although a malignant process cannot be 
completely excluded given enhancement characteristics. There is no intra
 or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. The spleen appears normal. 
The gallbladder is distended and exhibits wall thickening with 
surrounding fat stranding. Acute cholecystitis is suspected. The 
pancreas has a normal contour and attenuation characteristics. There is 
no evidence of an adrenal mass. Both kidneys demonstrate prompt and 
equal nephrograms. The kidneys are normal in size, shape, and 
configuration. There is no evidence of renal or ureteral mass. No renal 
or ureteral calculi are identified. There is no hydroureter or 
hydronephrosis. There is no evidence of appendicitis. Minimal wall 
thickening is observed in the descending colon, which may be suggestive 
of mild colitis. No evidence for small or large bowel obstruction is 
present. There is no evidence of abdominal ascites or lymphadenopathy. 
There is no evidence of intrinsic or extrinsic bladder mass. The uterus 
appears normal. The left ovary appears enlarged and demonstrates a 3 cm 
simple cyst. A small amount of fluid is present in the pelvic 
cul-de-sac. Images of the lung bases show no evidence of pleural or 
parenchymal mass. There are no pleural effusions. The bony structures 
are free of lytic or blastic lesions. IMPRESSION: 4.0 cm hypodense 
lesion in the left hepatic lobe, as described above. Further evaluation 
with MRI or biopsy may be considered for clarification of the diagnosis.
 Findings suggestive of acute cholecystitis. Surgical correlation is 
recommended. Mild wall thickening in the descending colon, possibly 
indicative of mild colitis. Clinical correlation is advised. Simple cyst
 in the left ovary and a small amount of fluid in the pelvic cul-de-sac.
 Follow-up with pelvic ultrasound is recommended.</td></tr>

 ABDOMEN &amp; PELVISHISTORY: Suspected mesenteric ischemia.  TECHNIQUE:
 Oral contrast was administered to the patient. The patient was fully 
informed of the nature and risks of intravenous contrast. Written 
informed consent was granted. Non-ionic contrast was administered 
intravenously without complication. A helical CT was acquired from the 
lung bases through the symphysis pubis. Maximum intensity pixel images 
were reconstructed and reviewed as well. Images were reviewed in lung 
windows, bone windows, and abdominal windows. Delayed images were also 
acquired.  FINDINGS: Abdomen: The lung bases are clear, and the heart is
 not enlarged. There is no aneurysmal dilatation of the aorta, but 
moderate atherosclerotic calcification is noted. Bony structures are 
age-appropriate, and muscular structures appear intact. The liver, 
spleen, adrenal glands, and gallbladder are morphologically normal with 
typical enhancement. The pancreas demonstrates a 2.8 cm cystic lesion in
 the tail, likely representing a pancreatic cyst or pseudocyst. No free 
air, free fluid, or inflammatory change is observed. The stomach and 
visualized portions of the small bowel and large bowel appear normal. 
There is no evidence of mesenteric ischemia, and no portal, 
retroperitoneal, or mesenteric adenopathy is present. There is no 
omental caking.  Pelvis: The ureters have a normal course and caliber. 
The bladder exhibits a normal configuration. The prostate gland is 
unremarkable. Bony, muscular, and vascular structures are 
age-appropriate, with no aneurysmal dilatation of arterial structures. 
No free air, free fluid, or inflammatory change is present. The 
visualized portions of the small bowel are normal. Mild diverticulosis 
is present in the sigmoid colon, without radiographic evidence for 
diverticulitis. No pelvic or inguinal adenopathy is observed.  
IMPRESSION: Abdomen:  2.8 cm cystic lesion in the tail of the pancreas, 
likely representing a pancreatic cyst or pseudocyst. Further evaluation 
with MRI or EUS may be considered. Moderate atherosclerotic 
calcification without evidence of aneurysmal dilatation of the aorta. 
Pelvis:  Mild diverticulosis without radiographic evidence for 
diverticulitis. No evidence of mesenteric ischemia.</td></tr>

 ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST, LOW DOSE: CLINICAL BACKGROUND: A 
38-year-old individual reports occasional episodes of abdominal 
discomfort and pain. COMPARATIVE STUDY: Not available. TECHNIQUE: The 
abdomen and pelvis underwent an unenhanced low dose CT scan, with no use
 of intravenous or oral contrast agents. OBSERVATIONS: No remarkable 
findings are identified in the lower thoracic region, liver, biliary 
system, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, or reproductive structures. 
The gastrointestinal tract does not display any dilation, and there is 
no evidence of thickened bowel walls or abnormal appendix. Neither free 
fluid nor air is detected within the peritoneal space. There is a subtle
 distal left periureteral fat stranding. The blood vessels appear 
typical, with no noteworthy irregularities. No swollen lymph nodes are 
seen. A single 3 mm stone is located in the posterior urinary bladder 
wall's dependent portion. No concerning findings or anomalies are 
observed in the bones and soft tissues. CONCLUSION: Absence of ureteral 
stones or hydronephrosis. The presence of a 3 mm stone in the urinary 
bladder and mild periureteral fat stranding on the left side may suggest
 a kidney stone that has recently passed.</td></tr>

 and unintentional weight lossTECHNIQUE: Multiple axial and coronal CT 
images were obtained through the abdomen and pelvis after administration
 of intravenous contrast material. FINDINGS: The liver demonstrates a 
4.5 x 3.8 cm hypodense mass in segment VIII with peripheral contrast 
enhancement suggestive of a hepatic hemangioma. The intrahepatic and 
extrahepatic biliary ducts are not dilated. The gallbladder, pancreas, 
spleen, and adrenal glands are unremarkable. Multiple small mesenteric 
lymph nodes measuring up to 1.5 cm in the short axis are identified,

bowel loops are normal, without obstruction, wall thickening, or 
dilatation. No free air or fluid is noted in the peritoneal cavity. The 
urinary bladder is normal in contour, and the prostate gland is mildly 
enlarged with an estimated volume of 35 cc, consistent with benign 
prostatic hypertrophy. IMPRESSION: Hepatic hemangioma in segment VIII of
 the liver. Reactive mesenteric lymphadenopathy. Mildly enlarged
