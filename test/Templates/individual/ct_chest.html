Evaluate for possible lung infection or mass. TIME: __ at __. 
COMPARISON: Chest x-ray performed __.TECHNIQUE: Volumetric scanning of 
the chest was carried out using 3 mm collimation at 3 mm intervals after
 administering 90 ml of a nonionic contrast agent. DLP = 1202.30 mGy*cm.
 FINDINGS: There is a mild bilateral pleural effusion with trace left 
basilar atelectasis. No signs of empyema or abscess formation are 
evident. A 3 mm pleural-based nodule is detected in the left upper lobe 
(image #38). A subcentimeter pulmonary nodule is seen adjacent to the 
left major fissure (image #46). A small nodule is present in the right 
middle lobe (image #44). A 5 mm apparent nodule/scar is noted in the 
right lower lobe (image #78). A minuscule nodule is also observed in the
 right lower lobe (image #79). The remaining lung fields appear 
unremarkable. A single posterior mediastinal lymph node measuring up to 7
 mm is present on the left (image #70). The partially visualized liver 
appears within normal size limits. Limited evaluation of the lower chest
 structures is unremarkable. Mild degenerative changes are seen in the 
thoracic spine. The adjacent bony structures and soft tissues appear 
normal. IMPRESSION: Mild bilateral pleural effusion with trace left base
 atelectasis. No evidence of empyema or abscess within the thoracic 
cavity. Several small pleural nodules of uncertain etiology. Mild 
degenerative changes in the thoracic spine. No significant abnormality 
detected in the contrast-enhanced CT scan of the chest.EXAM: CHEST CT

 CHEST CT SCAN WITHOUT CONTRAST EXAM DATE: __.HISTORY: 55-year-old 
female with persistent cough and chest tightness. Comparison: No prior 
CT scans available. TECHNIQUE: High-resolution helical CT imaging of the
 chest was performed using 5 mm slice thickness. Sagittal and coronal 
reformatted images were assessed. DLP: 680 mGy-cm FINDINGS: No pleural 
or pericardial effusions are observed. Mediastinal lymph nodes are 
within normal limits, with no significant enlargement. No axillary 
lymphadenopathy is present. The thoracic aorta exhibits a normal 
caliber. Bilateral patchy ground-glass opacities are evident in the 
upper lobes, more prominently on the right side. A few scattered nodules
 are present in both lower lobes, the largest measuring 0.8 x 0.7 x 0.5 
cm in the right lower lobe (image 65). The left lower lobe displays a 
focal area of linear atelectasis. Mild bronchial wall thickening is 
observed in the left lower lobe. The visualized upper abdominal 
structures appear unremarkable, and the osseous structures are intact. 
IMPRESSION: Bilateral patchy ground-glass opacities in the upper lobes, 
more pronounced on the right side. These findings may be related to a 
viral or atypical pneumonia. Clinical correlation and follow-up imaging 
after appropriate treatment are recommended. A few scattered nodules in 
both lower lobes, with the largest in the right lower lobe. Given their 
small size, these nodules are likely benign. However, a follow-up CT 
scan in 6-12 months is suggested to ensure stability. Focal linear 
atelectasis and mild bronchial wall thickening in the left lower lobe. 
No pleural or pericardial effusions and normal mediastinal lymph nodes.</td></tr>

 CHEST CT SCAN WITHOUT CONTRAST CLINICAL HISTORY: A 68-year-old male 
with a history of smoking, chronic cough, and dyspnea, suspicion of 
emphysema. COMPARISON: Chest x-ray dated __. TECHNIQUE: CT chest without
 contrast was performed. CTDIvol: 11.8 mGy. DLP: 420 mGy*cm. FINDINGS: 
There is diffuse centrilobular emphysema involving both lungs, more 
pronounced in the upper lobes, characterized by multiple areas of low 
attenuation and destruction of pulmonary parenchyma with associated 
vascular attenuation. No focal lung masses, nodules, or significant 
areas of consolidation are identified. A few scattered subpleural bullae
 are present bilaterally, the largest in the right upper lobe measuring 
approximately 1.8 x 1.2 cm. The trachea and main bronchi are patent with
 no significant wall thickening or stenosis. There is no significant 
mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. The heart size is within normal 
limits, with mild atherosclerotic calcification of the coronary 
arteries. No pericardial effusion is noted. The visualized portions of 
the thoracic aorta are unremarkable without dissection or aneurysm. The 
pleura is unremarkable, with no pleural thickening, nodularity, or

 CHEST CT SCAN WITHOUT CONTRAST CLINICAL HISTORY: A 63-year-old female 
with a history of lung cancer, recent lung surgery, and progressive 
cough, now presenting with concern for new or recurrent disease. 
COMPARISON: Chest x-ray dated __ and postoperative CT chest dated __. 
TECHNIQUE: CT chest with intravenous contrast was performed. DLP: 460 
mGy*cm. FINDINGS: The lungs demonstrate multiple bilateral pulmonary 
nodules, the largest measuring 1.3 cm x 1.1 cm in the left lower lobe 
(image 57) and 0.8 cm x 0.7 cm in the right middle lobe (image 43), both
 of which have increased in size since the previous CT. Several smaller 
nodules are scattered throughout the remaining lung parenchyma, some of 
which also demonstrate interval growth. No areas of consolidation are 
identified. Postsurgical changes are noted in the right upper lobe, 
including scarring and volume loss. A small loculated right pleural 
effusion is present adjacent to the surgical site, measuring 
approximately 1.9 x 1.4 cm. No pneumothorax is appreciated. There is 
mild mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, with the largest 
subcarinal lymph node measuring 1.2 cm x 1.0 cm (image 35). The heart 
size is within normal limits, with mild atherosclerotic calcification of
 the coronary arteries. The thoracic aorta is unremarkable without 
dissection or aneurysm. The pleura is unremarkable, with no pleural 
thickening or nodularity. The chest wall is normal in appearance without
 masses, soft tissue abnormalities, or osseous lesions. Moderate 
degenerative changes are noted in the visualized thoracic spine. The 
visualized portions of the upper abdomen are grossly unremarkable, with 
no significant lymphadenopathy or organomegaly. IMPRESSION: Multiple 
bilateral pulmonary nodules, some of which have increased in size since 
the prior examination, concerning for metastatic disease. Postsurgical 
changes in the right upper lobe with scarring and volume loss, and a 
small loculated right pleural effusion. Mild mediastinal and bilateral 
hilar lymphadenopathy. Moderate degenerative changes in the thoracic 
spine and mild atherosclerotic calcification of the coronary arteries.</td></tr>
