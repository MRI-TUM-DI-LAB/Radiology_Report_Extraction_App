 BODY MRI: __CLINICAL HISTORY: 64-year-old male patient with a history 
of hepatocellular carcinoma, status post partial hepatectomy. Assessment
 for metastatic disease and treatment response. COMPARISON: Whole-body 
MRI dated __. IMAGING TECHNIQUE: Whole body MRI was performed using 
multisequence imaging, with postcontrast images obtained following the 
intravenous administration of 12 mL Dotarem.FINDINGS:The brain and 
sinuses appeared unremarkable, with no masses or abnormal enhancement. 
The cervical and supraclavicular regions were free of lymphadenopathy. 
In the chest, lungs were clear, without pulmonary nodules or masses, 
pleural or pericardial effusions, and no axillary, mediastinal, or hilar
 lymphadenopathy was observed. The abdomen showed postsurgical changes 
related to partial hepatectomy, with multiple new and enlarging 
enhancing hepatic lesions in the residual liver parenchyma, indicating 
progression of metastatic disease. The largest lesion in segment 6 
measured 4.2 x 3.8 cm, which increased from the prior examination. The 
spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands were unremarkable. Kidneys appeared
 normal in size and morphology, with no hydronephrosis or renal masses. 
No gastrointestinal tract abnormalities were noted. Several enlarged 
retroperitoneal lymph nodes were identified, with the largest measuring 
2.2 x 1.8 cm in the para-aortic region, indicating disease progression. 
The urinary bladder and prostate appeared normal, and no pelvic 
lymphadenopathy or abnormal fluid collections were observed. 
Musculoskeletal examination revealed several new osseous lesions with 
abnormal enhancement and marrow signal changes, concerning for 
metastatic disease. The most notable lesions included the T12 vertebral 
body, measuring 1.5 x 1.3 cm, the left iliac bone, measuring 2.1 x 1.8 
cm, and the right femoral neck, measuring 1.3 x 1.1 cm. IMPRESSION: The 
findings suggest progression of metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma, 
with multiple new and enlarging hepatic lesions, enlarged 
retroperitoneal lymph nodes, and new osseous metastases involving the 
T12 vertebral body, left iliac bone, and right femoral neck.

 BODY MRI: __CLINICAL HISTORY: 32-year-old female patient with a known 
history of tuberous sclerosis.COMPARISON: Whole-body MRI dated __. 
IMAGING TECHNIQUE: Whole body MRI was performed using multisequence 
imaging, with postcontrast images obtained following the intravenous 
administration of 12 mL Dotarem.FINDINGS:Brain: Several cortical and 
subcortical tubers in the brain, most notably in the left frontal lobe 
and right parietal lobe, along with subependymal nodules near the 
foramina of Monro. No hydrocephalus or mass effect was noted. There was 
evidence of a subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) in the region 
of the right foramen of Monro, measuring 1.2 x 1.0 cm, which appeared 
stable when compared to the prior examination. The cerebellum, 
brainstem, and cranial nerves appeared unremarkable. No abnormal 
enhancement or restricted diffusion was noted in the brain parenchyma. 
Abdomen: The abdominal MRI revealed multiple angiomyolipomas involving 
both kidneys, with the largest lesion in the upper pole of the right 
kidney measuring 3.4 x 3.1 cm. These lesions appeared stable compared to
 the previous examination. No hydronephrosis or renal masses were 
identified. The liver showed multiple small hypointense lesions on 
T1-weighted images and hyperintense lesions on T2-weighted images, 
consistent with hepatic hamartomas. No intrahepatic or extrahepatic 
biliary duct dilation was observed. The pancreas, spleen, and adrenal 
glands appeared unremarkable. No retroperitoneal or mesenteric 
lymphadenopathy was noted. The gastrointestinal tract, urinary bladder, 
and reproductive organs were unremarkable. The musculoskeletal 
examination showed no significant abnormalities, and no suspicious 
osseous lesions were identified. IMPRESSION: The MRI findings are 
consistent with the patient's known history of tuberous sclerosis. 
Several cortical and subcortical tubers, subependymal nodules, and a 
stable SEGA were observed in the brain. The abdominal examination 
revealed multiple angiomyolipomas in both kidneys and hepatic 
hamartomas, with no significant interval change when compared to the 
prior examination. No new or concerning findings were identified.</td></tr>

hyperintense lesion is seen within the right gluteus medius muscle, 
which may represent a benign hemangioma. No other suspicious osseous or 
soft tissue lesions are identified. The upper extremities distal to the 
upper arm, and the lower extremities distal to the ankle are not 
included within the field of view and are not evaluated. IMPRESSION: No

 HISTORY: 61-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus 
erythematosus (SLE). Whole-body MRI for disease evaluation and possible 
complications. COMPARISON: Prior whole-body MRI from __. TECHNIQUE: 
Whole-body MRI was performed on a 3 Tesla scanner, covering from the 
vertex of the skull to the feet in multiple stations. Sequences 
included: sagittal T1, coronal STIR, and axial T2-weighted images. 
Following the uneventful intravenous administration of 12 mL Dotarem, 
post-contrast axial T1-weighted images with fat saturation were 
obtained. FINDINGS: Head/Neck: No abnormal enhancement or masses in the 
brain parenchyma. No evidence of cervical or supraclavicular 
lymphadenopathy. Visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells 
appear clear. Chest: Lungs are clear without evidence of consolidation 
or effusion. No suspicious pulmonary nodules or masses. No mediastinal, 
hilar, or axillary lymphadenopathy. Heart size and contour appear within
 normal limits. No pericardial effusion. Abdomen/Pelvis: Liver, spleen, 
pancreas, and adrenal glands are unremarkable without any focal lesions.
 Kidneys appear normal without hydronephrosis or solid renal masses. The
 bowel appears unremarkable without evidence of obstruction or 
inflammatory changes. No free fluid within the abdomen or pelvis. No 
pathologically enlarged lymph nodes within the abdomen or pelvis. There 
is a 2.7 cm, T2-hyperintense, mildly enhancing lesion in the posterior 
aspect of the uterus, likely representing a uterine fibroid. 
Musculoskeletal: No aggressive osseous lesions identified. Mild 
degenerative changes are noted in the lumbar spine and both hip joints. A
 small focal area of T2 hyperintensity in the right femoral head is 
suggestive of bone marrow edema, which may be secondary to mild 
avascular necrosis or inflammatory changes related to SLE. No suspicious
 soft tissue masses or significant joint effusions. IMPRESSION: No 
evidence of active systemic lupus erythematosus complications in the 
visualized organs. Mild degenerative changes in the lumbar spine and 
both hip joints. Small focus of bone marrow edema in the right femoral 
head, which may be secondary to mild avascular necrosis or inflammatory 
changes related to SLE. Clinical correlation is advised. Uterine fibroid
 in the posterior aspect of the uterus.</td></tr>
