 ELBOW:  __.CLINICAL HISTORY: Left wrist pain. Technique: Multiplanar, 
multisequence MR imaging of the left wrist, including coronal, sagittal,
 and axial T1 images, and coronal, sagittal, and axial STIR images. 
FINDINGS: The MRI demonstrates no definite osseous signal abnormality 
within the carpal bones. The bones are well aligned, and the articular 
surfaces are smooth. However, there is subtle bone marrow edema 
involving the scaphoid and lunate bones, which is best seen on the STIR 
images. There is no evidence of fracture, dislocation, or subluxation. 
The scapholunate ligament appears mildly thickened and demonstrates 
increased signal intensity on STIR images, suggesting a possible partial
 tear. The lunotriquetral ligament, triangular fibrocartilage complex 
(TFCC), and other intercarpal ligaments are unremarkable. The flexor and
 extensor tendons are intact, and there is no evidence of tendinopathy 
or tenosynovitis. A small joint effusion is seen in the radiocarpal and 
midcarpal joints. The surrounding muscles and soft tissues are 
unremarkable without edema or inflammation. The median and ulnar nerves 
are intact, with no evidence of compression or injury. IMPRESSION: The 
MRI findings suggest subtle bone marrow edema involving the scaphoid and
 lunate bones, a possible partial tear of the scapholunate ligament, and
 small joint effusion in the radiocarpal and midcarpal joints. No 
additional significant abnormality is identified. Recommendations: 
Clinical correlation is advised to determine the relevance of these 
findings in relation to the patient's symptoms. Further evaluation and 
treatment options should be discussed with the patient's healthcare 
provider, considering the patient's symptoms and physical examination 
findings. Potential management options may include conservative measures
 such as immobilization, physical therapy, and activity modification, or
 surgical intervention if warranted.</td></tr>

 ELBOW:  __.CLINICAL HISTORY: Patient presents with left wrist pain and 
reports a recent history of scaphoid fracture.TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar, 
multisequence MR imaging of the left wrist, including coronal proton 
density, T2 fat-saturated, axial T2 fat-saturated, proton density, and 
sagittal T2 fat-saturated images were evaluated.FINDINGS: There is a 
non-displaced fracture of the scaphoid waist, which demonstrates 
surrounding bone marrow edema. The fracture line is best appreciated on 
the coronal proton density and T2 fat-saturated images. The surrounding 
soft tissues show mild edema.The other carpal bones and distal radius 
and ulna are unremarkable without evidence of fracture or subluxation. 
The articular surfaces appear smooth, and no significant joint effusion 
is identified.The scapholunate and lunotriquetral ligaments are intact. 
The triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) demonstrates normal signal 
intensity and morphology. The flexor and extensor tendons are preserved 
without evidence of tear, tendinopathy, or tenosynovitis.A small region 
of T2 hyperintensity is observed within the abductor pollicis brevis 
muscle, suggesting mild strain or edema. The median and ulnar nerves 
appear unremarkable without signs of compression or 
injury.IMPRESSION:Non-displaced fracture of the scaphoid waist with 
surrounding bone marrow edema and mild soft tissue edema.Intact 
scapholunate, lunotriquetral ligaments, and TFCC.No significant joint 
effusion.Mild strain or edema within the abductor pollicis brevis 
muscle.No additional significant abnormality.RECOMMENDATIONS: Clinical 
correlation is advised to determine the relevance of these findings in 
relation to the patient's symptoms. Immobilization and follow-up imaging
 may be considered to monitor the healing of the scaphoid fracture. 
Further evaluation and treatment options should be discussed with the 
patient's healthcare provider, considering the patient's symptoms and 
physical examination findings. Potential management options may include 
conservative measures such as immobilization, physical therapy, and 
activity modification, or surgical intervention if warranted.</td></tr>

 ELBOW:  __.CLINICAL HISTORY: The patient presents with right elbow pain
 and limited range of motion, with a recent history of repetitive 
overhead activities. TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar, multisequence MR imaging of
 the right elbow was performed, including coronal proton density, T2 
fat-saturated, axial T2 fat-saturated, proton density, and sagittal T2 
fat-saturated images. FINDINGS: The MRI examination of the right elbow 
reveals the humerus, radius, and ulna without evidence of fracture or 
dislocation. No significant joint effusion or osseous contusions are 
identified. Mild degenerative changes are seen at the radiocapitellar 
joint with some irregularity of the cartilage. The medial collateral 
ligament complex is intact, including the anterior and posterior bands, 
without evidence of tear or sprain. The lateral collateral ligament 
complex is preserved, and no injury is seen. The common extensor tendon 
shows increased signal intensity and thickening, consistent with 
tendinopathy. No full-thickness tear is identified. The common flexor 
tendon and biceps tendon appear unremarkable, without evidence of tear 
or tendinopathy. Mild T2 hyperintensity is observed within the extensor 
carpi radialis brevis muscle, suggesting edema or strain secondary to 
tendinopathy. The surrounding muscles are unremarkable, without evidence
 of atrophy, edema, or denervation changes. The brachial artery, ulnar 
artery, and radial artery are patent without narrowing or occlusion. The
 median, radial, and ulnar nerves appear unremarkable, without signs of 
compression or injury. IMPRESSION: The MRI findings are consistent with 
lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow), predominantly involving the 
extensor carpi radialis brevis muscle. There is associated common 
extensor tendinopathy and mild muscle edema. No additional significant 
abnormality is identified. RECOMMENDATIONS: Clinical correlation is 
advised to determine the relevance of these findings in relation to the 
patient's symptoms. Conservative management, including activity 
modification, physical therapy, and anti-inflammatory medications, may 
be considered for the treatment of lateral epicondylitis. Further 
evaluation and treatment options should be discussed with the patient's 
healthcare provider, considering the patient's symptoms and physical 
examination findings.</td></tr>

 ELBOW:  __.EXAMINATION: MRI of the right elbow. CLINICAL HISTORY: The 
patient presents with right elbow pain and swelling, with a recent 
history of repetitive activities involving elbow flexion and extension. 
TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar, multisequence MR imaging of the right elbow was 
performed, including coronal proton density, T2 fat-saturated, axial T2 
fat-saturated, proton density, and sagittal T2 fat-saturated images. 
FINDINGS: The MRI examination of the right elbow reveals the humerus, 
radius, and ulna without evidence of fracture or dislocation. The 
articular surfaces appear smooth, and a small joint effusion is 
identified. The medial and lateral collateral ligament complexes are 
intact, without evidence of tear or sprain. The common flexor and 
extensor tendons are preserved, but the distal biceps tendon shows 
increased signal intensity and mild thickening, consistent with 
tendinopathy. No full-thickness tear is identified. Mild T2 
hyperintensity is observed within the biceps brachii muscle belly, 
suggesting edema or strain secondary to tendinopathy. The surrounding 
muscles appear unremarkable, without evidence of atrophy, edema, or 
denervation changes. The brachial, radial, and ulnar arteries are patent
 without narrowing or occlusion. The median, radial, and ulnar nerves 
appear unremarkable, without signs of compression or injury. IMPRESSION:
 The MRI findings are consistent with distal biceps tendinopathy, with 
associated muscle edema. A small joint effusion is present in the elbow 
joint. No additional significant abnormality is identified.</td></tr>

 ELBOW:  __.EXAMINATION: MRI of the left elbow. COMPARISON: __. CLINICAL
 HISTORY: The patient presents with a history of left elbow fracture 6 
to 8 weeks ago. The patient is unable to fully extend the elbow joint 
and requests an evaluation for possible loose bodies. TECHNIQUE: 
Three-plane localizer, axial proton density, axial T2 fat-sat, coronal 
proton density, coronal T2 fat-sat, and sagittal T2 fat-sat sequences 
were acquired. The study is slightly limited due to motion artifact and 
the patient's inability to completely extend the elbow joint. FINDINGS: A
 skin marker is in place at the location of the patient's previous 
injury. There is no significant joint effusion, and no definite joint 
body is demonstrated. A linear focus of low T1 and high T2 signal is 
observed extending through the lateral humeral epicondyle, consistent 
with a nondisplaced fracture. No displaced fracture fragments are 
identified. No definite avulsion of secondary ossification centers is 
demonstrated. The medial collateral ligament, radial collateral 
ligament, lateral ulnar collateral ligament, and annular ligament are 
intact. Mild thickening and mildly increased signal are seen at the 
common extensor tendon origin, which may correlate with mild partial 
tearing or lateral epicondylitis. No full-thickness tear is 
demonstrated. The remainder of the visualized tendons appears 
unremarkable. The bone marrow signal in the distal humerus is slightly 
increased diffusely, which may reflect altered biomechanics or prominent
 hematopoietic marrow. IMPRESSION: No joint effusion or joint bodies 
identified. Nondisplaced fracture of the lateral humeral epicondyle.
