 HIP: __. CLINICAL HISTORY: 55-year-old man with left hip pain and 
decreased range of motion, assessing for labral tear or osteoarthritis. 
COMPARISON: None available. PROCEDURE: Multiplanar, multisequence 
imaging of the left hip was performed at 3T without contrast. FINDINGS: 
There is a small joint effusion within the left hip. Cartilage, bones, 
and marrow: Mild degenerative changes are present in the left hip joint,
 with mild chondral thinning and subchondral cystic changes in the 
femoral head and acetabulum. No evidence of avascular necrosis or acute 
fracture. The bone marrow signal is unremarkable. A mild degenerative 
superior labral tear is identified, with adjacent mild chondral 
thinning. The iliopsoas, gluteus medius, gluteus minimus, and hamstring 
tendons are intact. No significant peritendinous edema or bursitis is 
observed. Unremarkable pelvic organs. No additional findings.  
IMPRESSION: Mild degenerative changes in the left hip joint, with mild 
chondral thinning and subchondral cystic changes in the femoral head and
 acetabulum. Mild degenerative superior labral tear with adjacent mild 
chondral thinning. Small left hip joint effusion. Intact iliopsoas, 
gluteus medius, gluteus minimus, and hamstring tendons without 
significant peritendinous edema or bursitis.</td></tr>

 HIP: __.CLINICAL HISTORY: 67-year-old woman with right hip pain, 
difficulty in ambulation, and stiffness, evaluating for possible 
arthritis or labral pathology. COMPARISON: X-ray right hip dated __. 
PROCEDURE: Multiplanar, multisequence imaging of the right hip was 
performed on a 3T MRI scanner without contrast. FINDINGS: Mild right hip
 joint effusion is noted. Cartilage, bones, and marrow: Moderate to 
severe degenerative changes are observed in the right hip joint, 
characterized by marked chondral loss, subchondral sclerosis, and 
multiple subchondral cysts in both the femoral head and acetabulum. No 
evidence of avascular necrosis or acute fracture. Bone marrow signal is 
within normal limits. A complex, full-thickness tear of the anterior 
labrum extending from the 1 o'clock to the 3 o'clock position is 
identified, with an adjacent paralabral cyst measuring approximately 1.2
 x 0.8 cm. Mild degeneration and fraying of the posterior labrum are 
also noted. The iliopsoas, gluteus medius, gluteus minimus, and 
hamstring tendons are intact, with no significant peritendinous edema or
 bursitis. Mild tendinosis is seen in the gluteus medius tendon 
insertion. Mild capsular thickening and enhancement suggest low-grade 
synovitis. Additional findings: Minimal edema is observed in the 
periarticular soft tissues, likely secondary to joint effusion and 
synovitis. IMPRESSION: Moderate to severe degenerative changes in the 
right hip joint with marked chondral loss, subchondral sclerosis, and 
cyst formation in the femoral head and acetabulum. Complex, 
full-thickness tear of the anterior labrum with an adjacent paralabral 
cyst, and mild degeneration of the posterior labrum. Mild right hip 
joint effusion with low-grade synovitis. Mild tendinosis of the gluteus 
medius tendon insertion. Periarticular soft tissue edema likely 
secondary to joint effusion and synovitis. </td></tr>

 HIP: __.CLINICAL HISTORY: 41 years of age, female, severe atraumatic 
pain R hip, radiating down R leg, also in buttock; lupus, chronic 
steroids. COMPARISON: CT hip __, radiograph hip __. PROCEDURE: 
Multiplanar, multisequence imaging of the right hip and pelvis was 
performed at 3T without contrast. Full field of view imaging of the 
pelvis was also obtained.FINDINGS: Comparison is made with a CT scan and
 radiograph of the hip from __. There is no significant joint effusion 
within the hip. The right sacroiliac joint demonstrates irregularity, 
but there is no acute edema or fracture. The articular cartilage appears
 well-preserved, and bone marrow signal intensity is normal. No 
avascular necrosis is identified, and the femoral head-neck contour 
appears normal. A tear of the right anterosuperior labrum is noted, 
accompanied by a 5 mm paralabral cyst. The iliopsoas tendon appears 
intact, with trace bursal fluid. Mild tearing of the gluteus minimus and
 medius tendons at the greater trochanteric insertion is observed, along
 with adjacent peritendinous edema. No significant greater trochanteric 
bursitis is present. The gluteal, hamstring, and adductor tendons appear
 intact. A mild narrowing of the ischiofemoral interval is observed, 
with edema in the quadratus femoris muscle. A renal allograft is seen in
 the right hemipelvis. The sciatic nerve appears unremarkable. 
IMPRESSION: Low-grade partial tearing of the gluteus minimus and medius 
tendons at the right greater trochanter. This is not an acute 
abnormality. Right anterosuperior labral tear, with a small paralabral 
cyst. Narrowing of the right ischiofemoral interval with edema and 
quadratus femoris, can be seen in setting of ischiofemoral impingement.</td></tr>

 HIP: __.CLINICAL HISTORY: A 54-year old woman with a history of right 
hip pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) presents with worsening pain
 and discomfort. PROCEDURE: Multiplanar, multisequence imaging of the 
left hip was performed at 3T before and after the uneventful 
administration of IV gadolinium contrast. FINDINGS: Extensive intra and 
extra-articular signal abnormality, consistent with the patient's 
history of PVNS. The abnormality originates from the right hip and 
extends into the ischiofemoral interval. It invades the proximal 
anterior compartment of the thigh anteriorly, infiltrates the adductors 
and obturator externus muscles medially, and extends into the gluteal 
musculature posteriorly. Laterally, the PVNS wraps around the posterior 
greater trochanter. The posterior margin of the PVNS is adjacent to the 
right ischial tuberosity and abuts the sciatic nerve without causing 
abnormal nerve signal. At the level of the ischiofemoral interval, the 
PVNS spans an area of approximately 17.4 x 13.8 x 9.6 cm (SI x 
transverse x AP), indicating a slight increase in size since the 
previous examination. There is bony involvement of the femoral head and 
neck, lesser trochanter, and acetabulum. Cortical erosion is present, 
which can be seen more clearly on the comparison radiograph. No acute 
pathologic fracture is identified. Mild peritendinous fluid is seen 
surrounding the distal iliopsoas tendon, which is otherwise intact. The 
hamstring and gluteal tendons are also intact. A small hip joint 
effusion is present, and mild articular cartilage loss is observed in 
the hip. Anterior labral degeneration and tearing are present. A few 
left inguinal lymph nodes are seen, measuring up to 1.1 cm in short 
axis, which are nonspecific and have slightly increased in size since 
the previous examination. Two small external iliac lymph nodes measure 
up to 0.7 and 1.0 cm, also showing a slight increase in size since the 
previous examination. The imaged pelvis appears normal, with no free 
fluid in the pelvic region. IMPRESSION: Extensive intra- and 
extra-articular pigmented villonodular synovitis of the hip, with a 
slight increase in size relative to previous examinations. </td></tr>

anterior-superior quadrant. The ligamentum teres appears thickened and 
mildly edematous. There is a moderate joint effusion. A small paralabral
