 OF THE BRAIN, WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST: CLINICAL HISTORY: 31-year-old 
male with a history of ependymoma post resection. Assess for tumor 
recurrence. TECHNIQUE: Standard tumor protocol MRI of the brain was 
executed before and after the seamless administration of intravenous 
gadolinium-based contrast on a 1.5 Tesla magnet using the following 
sequences: 3-plane localizer, sagittal T2, axial T2 TSE, sagittal FLAIR,
 axial SWI axial diffusion-weighted imaging, coronal-oblique TIRM of the
 whole brain, coronal T1 pre- and postcontrast imaging of the sella, 
sagittal postcontrast imaging of the sella, axial, sagittal, and coronal
 T1 whole brain postcontrast imaging. FINDINGS: Postoperative 
modifications in the right parietal region and particularly the right 
parietal lobe with encephalomalacia and gliosis are constant when 
compared to the previous examination. A solid and cystic mass with a 
contrast-enhancing nodular component is once more evident in the lateral
 parietal region. The enhancing nodular component, as well as the cystic
 component, seem stable in size and extent. No additional abnormal 
enhancement areas are observed. No new masses are identified. The 
right-sided posterior fossa arachnoid cyst, adjacent to the cerebellum, 
remains unaltered compared to the prior examination. The mild mass 
effect on the neighboring brainstem appears stable. The ventricles 
exhibit no significant changes in size. No signs of acute infarction or 
hemorrhage. Bilateral mastoid effusions have increased compared to the 
previous examination. The paranasal sinuses appear clear. Reactive 
changes in the soft tissue next to the surgical site appear stable. The 
globes and orbits maintain a normal appearance. IMPRESSION: Stable right
 lateral parietal ependymoma and adjacent arachnoid cyst, as well as 
postoperative changes. No new enhancing masses, infarctions, or 
intracerebral hemorrhages. Increased mastoid effusions of undetermined 
clinical importance.COMPARISON: __</td></tr>

 OF THE BRAIN, WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST: CLINICAL HISTORY: 60-year-old 
female with persistent headaches and history of hypertension. 
COMPARISON: MRI dated __. TECHNIQUE: MRI of the brain was performed with
 and without IV contrast, utilizing multiple sequences including 
diffusion, T2, FLAIR, T1, GRE, and post gadolinium T1 axial, coronal, 
sagittal sequences. Additional sequence for IAC imaging. Imaging 
performed on a 3 Tesla magnet before and after the uneventful 
administration of 9 mL of Gadavist IV. FINDINGS: Compared to the prior 
study, there is a new small area of restricted diffusion in the left 
frontal subcortical white matter, suggestive of a small acute 
infarction. No evidence of hemorrhage or mass effect is seen. A few 
punctate foci of T2/FLAIR hyperintensity in the periventricular and 
subcortical white matter are noted, likely representing chronic 
microvascular ischemic changes. These findings are stable compared to 
the prior examination. There is no evidence of intracranial mass or 
metastasis. The ventricular system is stable in size and configuration. 
No midline shift or significant mass effect is seen. The major 
intracranial flow voids are preserved, and no major vessel occlusion is 
noted. The dedicated IAC images show no abnormality of the seventh and 
eighth cranial nerve complexes. There is a stable appearance of the 
paranasal sinuses with mucosal thickening in the bilateral maxillary 
sinuses and ethmoid air cells, suggesting chronic sinusitis. IMPRESSION:

and recent onset of blurred vision. COMPARISON: MRI brain on __. 
TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar, multisequence MRI of the brain was obtained, 
including the following sequences: T1, T2, FLAIR, GRE, diffusion, and 
dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) perfusion. 10 mL of Gadavist 
contrast was administered intravenously, and then postcontrast images of
 the brain were obtained. FINDINGS: MRI BRAIN: A 1.5 cm enhancing mass

No significant mass effect is observed. The mass is new compared to the 
prior study. There is no evidence of hemorrhage or acute infarct. 
Ventricles and sulci appear normal. Bones and soft tissues are 
unremarkable. Normal flow voids are seen within the major intracranial 
vessels. DSC PERFUSION: Increased perfusion is noted within the 
enhancing mass in the right temporal lobe. IMPRESSION: New enhancing 
mass in the right temporal lobe with surrounding vasogenic edema and 
increased perfusion, suspicious for a neoplasm. Further evaluation, 
including a dedicated contrast-enhanced brain MRI and potential biopsy,

MRI dated __. TECHNIQUE: Three-plane localizer, sagittal T1, axial 
diffusion, axial T2, axial GRE, and axial T1. Postcontrast axial and 
coronal with fat saturation through the brain, and axial T1 whole brain 
post. HISTORY: 55-year-old male with progressive headaches and visual 
disturbances. FINDINGS: There is a new, irregularly-shaped, T2 
hyperintense and T1 isointense lesion in the right occipital lobe, 
measuring approximately 3.0 x 3.5 cm on image 6 of series 7. The lesion 
demonstrates heterogeneous enhancement on post-contrast images, 
suggesting a possible neoplastic process. The mass is associated with 
surrounding vasogenic edema, resulting in mild mass effect and local 
compression of the adjacent occipital horn of the lateral ventricle. 
There are also a few scattered foci of T2 signal hyperintensity in the 
periventricular and subcortical white matter regions, consistent with 
chronic small vessel ischemic disease. No additional abnormal 
parenchymal signal or enhancing lesions are seen. The ventricular system
 is normal in size and configuration. No midline shift or herniation is 
identified. The surrounding soft tissues and bone marrow demonstrate 
appropriate MR signal characteristics. The paranasal sinuses and mastoid
 air cells are clear. IMPRESSION: New right occipital lobe lesion with 
heterogeneous enhancement and vasogenic edema, suspicious for neoplastic
 process. Further evaluation and clinical correlation are recommended.

features suggestive of a hemangioblastoma, although a low-grade glioma 
cannot be excluded. Further evaluation with follow-up imaging or

 __ CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 35-year-old patient with a history of 
severe headaches and visual disturbances. The patient is being evaluated
 for possible brain pathology. TECHNIQUE: Three-plane localizer, axial 
T1-weighted, axial T2-weighted, axial T2-weighted FLAIR, axial 
diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and coronal T2-weighted images. 
Intravenous contrast was administered, and post-contrast axial and 
coronal T1-weighted images were acquired. FINDINGS: No mass, hemorrhage,
 or acute infarct is identified. There is no midline shift or 
hydrocephalus. The ventricular system and sulci are within normal 
limits. There is a small area of T2 hyperintensity and post-contrast 
enhancement in the left occipital lobe, measuring approximately 0.8 x 
0.7 cm. This lesion is associated with minimal surrounding edema. The 
imaging findings are suggestive of a demyelinating lesion or possibly a 
small meningioma. No other abnormal parenchymal signal or enhancement is
 seen. The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. The orbits
 appear unremarkable. The major intracranial vessels demonstrate normal 
flow voids. IMPRESSION: A small enhancing lesion in the left occipital 
lobe, possibly representing a demyelinating lesion or a small 
meningioma. Further evaluation with follow-up imaging or neurological 
consultation may be warranted. No evidence of acute intracranial 
abnormality or other significant findings. Clear paranasal sinuses and 
mastoid air cells.</td></tr>
