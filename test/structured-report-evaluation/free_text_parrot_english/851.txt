Findings:

Mild dorsal basal atelectasis. Liver parenchyma is sharply defined and homogeneously enhanced. No evidence of focal liver lesions. Hepatic veins and portal vein are patent. Spleen is not enlarged. Kidneys show symmetrical contrast uptake. No hydronephrosis. Status post endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for polyps in the area of the right colonic flexure. Multiple clips in place with mild wall thickening. Cranial to the second clip (viewed from caudal), there is an approximately 0.3 cm wall defect with adjacent extraluminal contrast medium extravasation and extensive free air collections. Mild mesenteric imbibition throughout and moderate amounts of free fluid in the pelvis. No evidence of age-related degenerative changes.

Conclusion:
Colon perforation following ESD of a polyp in the right colonic flexure, with a CT-visible wall defect of approximately 0.3 cm cranial to the second clip (viewed from caudal). Moderate amounts of free fluid and diffuse mesenteric imbibition, indicative of peritonitis.
