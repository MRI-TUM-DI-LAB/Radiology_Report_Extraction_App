Findings:  
The costophrenic angles are clear on both sides, with no pleural effusions. There is a paracardiac fat pad on the left. Aortic sclerosis is present. There is a faint opacity in the left lower lung field. Subtle signs of pulmonary venous congestion are noted. The heart and aorta show a configuration suggestive of hypertension. Degenerative changes are observed in the thoracic spine. The soft tissue envelope appears unremarkable on initial assessment.

Impression:  
- Faint opacity in the left lower lung field, differential diagnosis includes early pneumonic infiltrate.
