Left parietal, axial mass measuring approximately 67 mm x 75 mm x 61 mm craniocaudal, dural-based, predominantly contrast-enhancing, T2-weighted hyperintense lesion, with a central arterial meningeal vessel visible on TOF imaging. Anterior to the lesion, there is another prominent vessel measuring up to 4 mm in diameter, showing partial arterial flow signal on TOF, most likely corresponding to a dural vein. There is a perilesional T2-FLAIR hyperintense area at the anteromedial and inferior margin of the mass. There is a local mass effect with compression of the posterior horn of the left lateral ventricle, resulting in a midline shift to the right of approximately 15 mm and left uncal herniation, similar to the previous day's examination. Scattered punctate bihemispheric T2-weighted/FLAIR hyperintense white matter lesions are noted. The TOF imaging shows normal depiction of the cerebral arterial vessels. Most likely hypoplastic left transverse sinus. Normal contrast enhancement of the major venous sinuses. The basal cisterns and foramen magnum are clearly visible. Partial empty sella. Paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well-aerated.
