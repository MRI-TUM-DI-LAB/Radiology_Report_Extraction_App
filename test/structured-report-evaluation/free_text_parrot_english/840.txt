Findings:

The basal sections of the lungs appear normal. There is significant fatty infiltration of the liver. The spleen is not enlarged. There is mild atrophy of the pancreas. Gallstones are present. There is a first-degree hydronephrosis on the left side, with evidence of a ureteral stone in the proximal/mid ureter measuring approximately 9 mm in craniocaudal diameter. There is an extensive left-sided abdominal wall hernia with herniated loops of small intestine and slight mesenteric imbibition near the hernia orifice. There are significant hardening artifacts due to bilateral hip replacements, which limit the assessment of the pelvic organs. No free fluid or free air is detected.

Impression:
- Evidence of a left-sided ureteral stone, approximately 9 mm in maximum diameter, with consequent first-degree hydronephrosis.
- Left-sided abdominal wall hernia with herniated bowel loops and mild mesenteric imbibition near the hernia orifice, differential diagnosis includes early incarceration. Clinical correlation is recommended.
