Findings: Limited assessability due to overlying extremities with corresponding hardening artifacts. Multiple calcifications in the breast parenchyma on both sides. Narrow pleural effusion on both sides. Otherwise, the basal lung sections appear unremarkable. Liver parenchyma is sharply defined. Spleen is not enlarged. Right-sided hydronephrosis Grade 2 with ureteral dilation to approximately 1.4 cm. At the crossing area of the common iliac artery, there is a stone measuring approximately 5 mm in the course of the ureter. Due to ultimately unclear conditions, an intraluminal position cannot be confirmed. Large hiatal hernia. Diverticulosis of the entire colon frame with slight pericolic imbibition around the ascending colon. Extensive calcification of the splenic artery. Indwelling catheter. Compression fracture of the L5 vertebral body, extending into the disc space. Cystic changes in the tendinous part of the right iliopsoas muscle.

Impression:
- Right-sided hydronephrosis Grade II with ureteral dilation and an approximately 5 mm stone, presumably in the mid-ureter.
- Imaging consistent with uncomplicated diverticulitis in the ascending colon, with diverticulosis of the entire colon frame.
- Slightly displaced vertebral fracture of L5, without evidence of posterior involvement.
