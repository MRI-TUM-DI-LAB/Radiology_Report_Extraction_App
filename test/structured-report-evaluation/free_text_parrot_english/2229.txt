Clinic, Question, Justifying Indication:Patient with central pulmonary artery embolism. Question regarding deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the legs.
Findings:No relevant previous examinations are available for comparison.
The following veins were examined bilaterally: the common femoral vein, the superficial femoral vein, the junction of the deep femoral vein, the popliteal vein, the anterior and posterior tibial veins, the fibular veins, as well as the junction of the great saphenous vein and the popliteal vein.
Respiratory-modulated flow was observed in the distal common femoral vein. On the left side, there is complete compressibility of the common femoral vein, as well as bilaterally in the superficial femoral vein, the junction of the deep femoral vein, the junction of the great saphenous vein, and the popliteal vein. Normal flow signals in the anterior and posterior tibial veins as well as the fibular veins, with also preserved complete compressibility of the vessel lumen.
The right common femoral vein is not fully compressible over a length of at least 3.5 cm due to hypoechoic intraluminal material. There is peripheral flow visible in Doppler sonography. The proximal end of the thrombus is not visible on ultrasound.
Assessment:Peripheral-flow thrombosis of the right common femoral vein. The proximal end of the thrombosis is not visible on ultrasound. No evidence of an occlusive pelvic vein thrombosis or deep vein thrombosis on the left side.
