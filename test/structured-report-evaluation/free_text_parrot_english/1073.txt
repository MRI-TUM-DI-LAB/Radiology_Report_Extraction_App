CT Head

The interhemispheric fissure is midline. The lateral ventricles are symmetrically displayed, with open basal cisterns and no evidence of cerebrospinal fluid circulation disturbance. There are hypodense changes in the subcortical and periventricular white matter on both sides. Bilateral calcifications of the basal ganglia are noted. An old defect area is present in the high frontal precentral region on the right, with no newly demarcated infarct. Compared to the previous examination, there is a newly distinguishable patchy hyperdensity in the left temporal cortex, consistent with a contusion hemorrhage, without mass effect. There is pseudophakia in both eyes. The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well-aerated. No fracture of the skull cap or facial bones is observed. There is soft tissue swelling in the left infraorbital region.
