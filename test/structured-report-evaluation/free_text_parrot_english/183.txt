Clinical Information, Question, Justification: Right arm paresis, aphasia, slowness, unclear time window. M1 occlusion on the left. Recanalization requested. Consent and Explanation: Emergency indication. Due to the patient's clinical condition, it was not possible to obtain a risk history, explanation, or consent. Anesthesia, Medications: Procedure performed under intubation anesthesia. Additional medications: none. Material: Access: Right common femoral artery, 9F sheath. Post-interventional closure of the puncture site with 8F AngioSeal and manual compression. Subsequently, a circular pressure bandage was applied. Catheter: 9F Cello, 5F diagnostic catheter. Aspiration catheter: 5F and 6F Sofia. Methodology and Findings: Placement of the balloon guide catheter into the right sub-basal internal carotid artery via the diagnostic catheter. Serial angiography. This shows the known M1 occlusion. Under proximal balloon protection, a large-bore aspiration catheter (6F Sofia) was introduced using the telescoping technique. It could not be advanced past a stenosis in the carotid siphon, so it was switched to a 5F Sofia. This could be advanced to the thrombus. Continuous aspiration and retrieval of a thrombus approximately 3 mm in length. The following serial angiography shows complete recanalization. In the final series, no vascular occlusions. Non-reactive manual intra-arterial contrast application. Technique: Biplanar DSA, total DAP 1838 cGy x cmÂ², fluoroscopy time 07:29 minutes. Series: 4. Result: Recanalization achieved through continuous thrombus aspiration and thrombectomy (TICI 3, first pass).
