CT Abdomen:

Findings:
The liver texture is homogeneous. No dilation of the bile ducts. The gallbladder is unremarkable. The pancreas shows no ductal dilation, surrounding reaction, or focal lesions. No adrenal masses are present. The spleen has a routine texture. The kidneys show symmetrical contrast enhancement, with slender renal pelvis and ureteral origins. The bladder is unremarkable. No ascites. No pneumoperitoneum. No suspiciously enlarged lymph nodes.

The gastrointestinal tract shows no segmental distention or surrounding reaction. The aorta demonstrates homogeneous contrast enhancement in the given contrast phase. The portal vein and its tributaries show homogeneous contrast enhancement. The abdominal wall is somewhat symmetrical. The dorsal alignment of the lumbar spine is preserved without vertebral body height reduction. On the right iliac side, opposite the right sacroiliac joint, there is evidence of a sclerotic osseous lesion (Series 11 Image 67) measuring 14mm, most likely corresponding to an enostosis.

Conclusion:
Unremarkable CT of the abdomen.
No evidence of abdominal malignancy.
No abdominal lymphadenopathy.
