Clinical Information, Question, Justification: Hepatic metastasis from choroidal melanoma. First TACE of the liver.

Technique and Findings: Supine position. Skin disinfection and sterile draping. After local anesthesia, ultrasound-guided, smooth retrograde puncture of the right common femoral artery and placement of a 10 cm 4F sheath. Cannulation of the celiac trunk using a 4F SIM1 catheter and celiac angiography. Subsequently, cannulation of the right hepatic artery using a microcatheter and, with regular position and flow checks, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) of the right liver lobe with the administration of approximately 50 mg of cisplatin and about 450 mg of Embocept until significant flow reduction. After repositioning the microcatheter into the left hepatic artery, additional TACE of the left liver lobe with another approximately 10 mg of cisplatin and about 90 mg of Embocept, also until significant flow reduction. Removal of catheter and sheath. Manual compression. Pressure bandage. Fluoroscopy time: 17.42 seconds. Dose area product (DAP): 5696.90 µGy*m² [diagnostic reference value for TACE 23000 µGy*m², Federal Office for Radiation Protection, last updated on August 16, 2018].

Conclusion: Technically successful and complication-free first TACE of the entire liver with the administration of 60 mg of cisplatin.
