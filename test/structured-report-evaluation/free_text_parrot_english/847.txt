Findings:  
In the context of a known COVID infection, there is a right-sided pleural effusion measuring approximately 9 mm in thickness, accompanied by adjacent atypical infiltrates. There are also mild ground-glass opacities on the left side and a minimal effusion. The liver shows homogeneous contrast enhancement without evidence of focal lesions; the portal vein and hepatic veins are clear. No evidence of cholestasis. There is borderline splenomegaly, but the pancreas and spleen appear otherwise unremarkable. The kidneys are in their normal position, with an ampullary renal pelvis on the right side. There is fecal loading in the colon. No evidence of infradiaphragmatic lymphadenopathy, as far as can be assessed. The bony structures appear normal.

Impression:  
There is no clear indication of the cause of the acute liver failure. Incidentally noted is a small right-sided pleural effusion and atypical infiltrates in the context of a known COVID infection.
