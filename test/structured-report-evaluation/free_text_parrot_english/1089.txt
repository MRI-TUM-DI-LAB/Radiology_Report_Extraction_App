MR Arthrography

No evidence of bone edema. 
Signal inhomogeneity at the insertion of the infraspinatus muscle and, to a lesser extent, at the insertion of the supraspinatus muscle. However, there is no contrast medium penetration into the subacromial bursa, and no definite focal disruption of the tendon contours is seen on T2-weighted sequences. There is a slight signal increase at the insertion of the subscapularis muscle. 
No significant muscle atrophy of the rotator cuff, with only a few isolated fatty streaks (Goutallier 0-1). 
The biceps tendon appears thinned at the transition into the intertubercular sulcus, with proximal signal increase and slight fraying. The short biceps tendon is unremarkable. 
No joint cartilage defects. Intact labrum. 
AC joint arthrosis with thickened joint capsule. 
Impression: 
Partial tear of the proximal long head of the biceps tendon. 
Degenerative changes of the rotator cuff with small partial tears at the insertion of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles. 
No atrophy of the rotator cuff.
