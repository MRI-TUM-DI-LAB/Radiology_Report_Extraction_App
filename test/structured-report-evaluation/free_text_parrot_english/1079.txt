Chest X-ray, PA and left lateral views

Enlarged heart (CTR= 0.57). Bilateral basal pleural effusion, peribronchial cuffing, and mild perihilar vascular blurring, primarily indicative of cardiopulmonary congestion. No confluent pneumonic infiltrate. Centered mediastinal appearance. Aortic sclerosis. Degenerative changes in the thoracic spine. Cortical irregularity on the right lateral clavicle, similar to previous examination, most likely due to an old traumatic lesion.
