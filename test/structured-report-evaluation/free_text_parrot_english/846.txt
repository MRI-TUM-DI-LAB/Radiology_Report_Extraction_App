Findings:

Mildly enlarged internal cerebrospinal fluid spaces. Corresponding to the previous examination, there is a narrow hyperdensity in the right frontotemporal region (4mm), with no change compared to the prior study. No evidence of new hyperdensities. Gray-white matter differentiation is preserved. The basal cisterns at the foramen magnum are clearly visible. No evidence of a skull fracture. The mastoid air cells and visualized paranasal sinuses are normally aerated.

Conclusion:
No significant changes in findings, with a persistent acute subdural hematoma in the right frontotemporal region.
