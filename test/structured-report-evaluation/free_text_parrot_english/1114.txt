CT Thorax

The subpleural consolidation in the left anterior upper lobe segment currently measures approximately 24 x 16 mm (previously 26 x 15 mm), with the immediately adjacent lesion appearing similar in size. Morphology remains unchanged. There is an aspect of increased perifocal interstitial markings.

Unchanged presentation of multiple lung cysts in the context of panlobular/paraseptal emphysema, comparable to lymphangioleiomyomatosis.

Unchanged interlobar and intralobular thickening, predominantly basal. No new infiltrates have developed.

Known cardiomegaly. Coronary sclerosis. No significant valve calcification.

Unchanged presentation of some formally pathologically enlarged lymph nodes, exemplified by pretracheal and infracarinal nodes. Open tracheobronchial system, with mild traction bronchiectasis, predominantly basal on both sides.

Normal appearance of the thoracic soft tissue mantle, no axillary lymphadenopathy.

Included upper abdominal organs: Unremarkable appearance of the liver, no evidence of focal liver lesions.

Skeletal system: Thoracic DISH. Unchanged appearance of the vertebral bodies, no osteolysis. Moderate kyphosis. Ventral longitudinal ligament calcification.

Assessment

Overall, nearly status idem, with unchanged presentation of the two adjacent small consolidations in the left anterior upper lobe segment.

Known multiple cyst formations in both lungs with some scarring alterations, predominantly apical.

No fresh inflammatory infiltrate.

Unchanged lymph node enlargement.

Cardiomegaly, suspected coronary artery disease.
