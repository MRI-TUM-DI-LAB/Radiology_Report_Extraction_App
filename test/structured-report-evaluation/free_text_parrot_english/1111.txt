CT Chest

Severe paraseptal and centrilobular emphysema. Increasing band-like consolidation with an oblique course through the left upper lobe, likely atelectatic. Unchanged 5 mm nodule in the laterobasal segment of the left lower lobe. No pleural effusions on either side. Partially regressed pericardial effusion (anterior lamella reduced from 11 mm to 8 mm). Normal contrast enhancement of thoracic vessels in the given contrast phase. Generalized vascular sclerosis. No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum or hila. Unchanged appearance of the thyroid gland. Preserved dorsal alignment. Known unchanged vertebral body height reductions, predominantly thoracic. Partially captured upper abdominal organs: suspected gallbladder sludge at the infundibulum, prehepatic colonic interposition (Chilaiditi syndrome). Pancreas unremarkable.

Impression

Pronounced COPD appearance. Increasing broad, oblique consolidation through the left upper lobe, likely due to atelectasis (tumor still not excluded). Unchanged small nodule in the laterobasal segment of the left lower lobe. No evidence of mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. Calcified coronary vessels. Asymptomatic cholecystolithiasis.
