Clinical Information, Question, Justification: Unclear vertebral fracture, differential diagnosis of malignancy. Query regarding vertebral metastases.

Technique: 1.5-Tesla MRI of the spine. Localizer. T2 TIRM sagittal, T2 TSE sagittal, T1-TSE sagittal, T1-TSE fs axial, and T2 TSE sagittal as indicated.

Findings/Assessment:
- Recent fracture of T10 vertebra with avulsion of osteophytes and underlying fluid signal in the vertebral body and disc at T10/11 (Series 12/8), differential diagnosis post-traumatic, differential diagnosis inflammatory due to diffuse surrounding reaction suggestive of spondylodiscitis (without epidural abscess). Minor posterior displacement up to 3 mm. Moderate spinal canal stenosis at this level.
- Up to 3 mm of unclear epidural fluid collection in the anterior spinal canal at the level of C2/3 (Series 12/11) without significant spinal canal stenosis, appearing as protein-rich fluid. No evidence of dens fracture.
- Older fractures of T1, T2, T3, T6, T8, T12, L1, L4, and L5. Status post kyphoplasty of T12 and L1 with posterior displacement of T12 by 2 mm (stable compared to previous examination) and L1 by 8 mm, with suspicion of minimally progressive fragment displacement of the superior endplate into the spinal canal (Series 16/8). Mild signal increase in vertebral bodies, differential diagnosis irritation.
- Multisegmental disc protrusion in the cervical spine, most prominent at C3/4, with severe accompanying spinal canal stenosis. Severe neuroforaminal stenosis at L4/5 bilaterally due to caudally displaced disc extrusion and endplate fracture of L4. No myelopathy signal.
- Mild fluid imbibition in the presacral fat tissue. Incidental renal cysts. Otherwise unremarkable soft tissues. Incidental small pleural effusion on both sides.
