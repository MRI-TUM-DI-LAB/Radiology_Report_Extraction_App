Clinical Information, Question, Justification: Hydrocephalus / Shunt with multiple valves. Findings. Methodology: 3T MRI of the head. Localization sequences. T2 SPC 3D iso, 3D CISS over the aqueduct and CSF flow sequences, 3D T1 MPRAGE. Findings: Comparison with previous external MRI scans. Known bilateral VP shunts: From the left frontal region with the tip in the third ventricle via the left foramen of Monro and from the right parietal region with the tip in the right lateral ventricle's posterior horn. As in previous exams, the ventricles appear slit-like. Basal cisterns are of normal wiRXh (rather narrow). No evidence of significant CSF flow obstruction in the flow sequences. No midline shift. Older burr hole defect in the left parietal skull with an adjacent tract in the left parietal lobe and a gliosis zone in the left lateral ventricle's posterior region. Long-standing stable periventricular white matter gliosis and known atrophy of the right white matter and the splenium. Known dysplasia of the sella turcica with a broadly based, partially extrasellar pituitary gland and slight deviation of the infundibulum to the right. Preserved T2-weighted flow void of the major intracranial vessels. Unremarkable bone signal of the neurocranium outside the mentioned trepanation defects. Small fluid retention in the right mastoid cells. Circular to polypoid mucosal swelling of the right maxillary sinus. Impression: No dislocation of the known ventricular shunts. Known slit-like configuration of the internal CSF spaces and partially thickened skull as a sign of chronic overdrainage.
