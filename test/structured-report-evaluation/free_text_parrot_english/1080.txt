Chest X-ray, anteroposterior view

Slightly rotated supine view. Patchy opacities in the left lower lung zone with a suggestion of an air bronchogram, suspicious for a pneumonic infiltrate. The heart is not enlarged, with no signs of cardiac decompensation, no significant pleural effusions extending cranially, and no mediastinal shift. Degenerative changes of the thoracic spine (spondylosis deformans).
