Findings:  
Status post application of an external fixator for a complex fracture of the right lower leg. The alignment remains unchanged in the presence of a severely displaced, comminuted fracture of the distal tibia involving the diaphysis, metaphysis, and epiphysis, as well as a displaced fracture of the distal fibular diaphysis. No evidence of secondary displacement. No evidence of a secondary fracture, as far as can be assessed radiographically.

Assessment:  
As far as can be assessed radiographically, the alignment remains largely unchanged following the application of an external fixator for a complex fracture of the right lower leg.
