Examination performed in the prone position using a high-resolution linear transducer. Age-appropriate normal ossification of the vertebral appendages with a normal wiRXh of the spinal canal. The conus is positioned normally at the L1/2 level for the patient's age, with normal wiRXh of the spinal cord and central canal. Normal oscillations of the spinal cord and fibrillations of the cauda equina are observed. No structural changes in the spinal cord area. No malformations or masses intra- or paraspinally. No connection from the spinal canal to subcutaneous or cutaneous structures.
