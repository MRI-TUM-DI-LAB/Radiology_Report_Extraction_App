CT Heart

Findings
1. Non-contrast CT with calcium scoring (tin filter used for radiation dose reduction). 2. Prospectively ECG-triggered CT coronary angiography using flash technique after administration of one ampoule (5 mg) of beta-blocker intravenously and 2 puffs of Isoket spray sublingually.
Total dose applied: 138 mGycm
Heart rate during data acquisition: 82 bpm
Calcium score: Total Score (Agatston Score): 0
CT Coronary Angiography:
Right dominant coronary circulation. Structurally tricuspid aortic valve. Normal anatomical course of the coronary vessels, ascending aorta diameter = 31 mm, myocardial mass ED x g (LV) (normal range 75 - 175).

LAD: Regular appearance, no stenoses, no plaques.
LCX: Regular appearance of the normal caliber vessel pathway, no stenoses.
RCA: Regular appearance of the vessel pathway, no stenoses.
Incidental findings: No mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy (as far as captured). Normal appearance of the basal lung sections included in the scan, no pleural effusion, no infiltrate.

Conclusion: Normal appearance of the coronary vessels with no evidence of coronary sclerosis. Normal anatomical course. No soft plaques. Right dominant coronary circulation. Structurally tricuspid aortic valve. No valve calcification.
