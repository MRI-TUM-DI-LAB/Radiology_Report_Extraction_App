Port catheter inserted via the left subclavian vein with the tip positioned in the right atrium.  
Large, inhomogeneous, poorly defined mass located ventromedially in the left upper lobe (approximately 8x6x11 cm) with infiltration into the mediastinum (including the upper pulmonary vein), the anterior chest wall, and compression of the left main bronchus, indicating significant progression of the previously known NSCLC. No other mass-forming or infiltrative processes observed. No pneumothorax, no pleural effusion. Minimal increase in size of the mediastinal lymph node (now: 5 mm, previously: 4 mm). Otherwise, axillary and hilar lymph nodes are unremarkable. Midline mediastinum. Heart chambers are properly contrasted. Significant arteriosclerosis. Stable dilation of the ascending aorta at 4 cm compared to previous examination.  
Stable size of liver cysts and adrenal masses consistent with adenomas.  
Degenerative changes with spondylophyte formations. Known compression fracture of T6 vertebra. No evidence of suspicious osseous lesions.
