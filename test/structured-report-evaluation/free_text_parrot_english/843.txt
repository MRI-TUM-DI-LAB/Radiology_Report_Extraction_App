Findings:

The lower neck regions appear unremarkable. The lung parenchyma is adjacent to the thoracic wall on all sides. On the right side, there are ground-glass opacities associated with bronchovascular structures. Subpleural cystic changes are noted dorsobasally. There is subtle fissural thickening and thickened lobar and segmental bronchi on the right side. 
No evidence of pathologically enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinal, hilar, or axillary regions. Status post triple-vessel coronary stenting. Calcification of the aortic and mitral valves. No evidence of contrast filling defects in the pulmonary arteries. No CT morphological signs of right heart strain. The abdominal organs included in the scan appear unremarkable. Severe degenerative changes in the spine.

Impression:
-No evidence of pulmonary artery embolism. No CT morphological signs of right heart strain.
-Focal ground-glass opacities in the right lung, which, in the appropriate clinical context, are consistent with atypical infiltrates.
