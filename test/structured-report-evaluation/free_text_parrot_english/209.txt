Clinical Information, Question, Justification for Examination: Choroidal melanoma. Staging. Query regarding liver mass. 

Findings: No prior examination available for comparison. 

Liver: Approximately 90% visible. Organ is normal in size (12 cm in midclavicular line). Margins are sharp, surface is smooth. Homogeneous echogenic parenchyma. No focal lesions identifiable in the visible area. Vascular pattern is normal. Visible hepatic veins are patent. Portal vein is of normal wiRXh with antegrade, borderline low flow (Vmax: 14 cm/s). 

Gallbladder: Gallbladder is not enlarged, with anechoic internal echo. Wall is of normal thickness with no signs of inflammation. 

Bile Ducts: Intrahepatic bile ducts are not dilated. Common bile duct is of normal wiRXh (5 mm) in the visible area. 

Pancreas: As far as visible, normal in size with echogenic parenchyma. Pancreatic duct is not dilated in the visible area. 

Spleen: Spleen is normal in size (10 x 3 cm) and shape. Homogeneous parenchyma. Splenic vein is patent. 

Kidneys and Urinary Tract: Kidneys are normal in size with age-appropriate parenchyma/pelvis ratio. No dilation of the renal collecting system. No solid masses identifiable. Bladder is slightly filled, anechoic with a prominent posterior wall, likely due to filling. 

Genital Organs: Calcified lesion approximately 2 x 2 x 2 cm in the myometrium. 

Retroperitoneum: As far as visible, no evidence of vascular changes or enlarged lymph nodes. 

Free Fluids: No ascites, no pleural effusions. 

Conclusion: No evidence of an abdominal mass suspicious for metastasis in the visible area. Appearance consistent with hepatic steatosis. Appearance of a calcified uterine fibroid (known from history). Slightly filled bladder with prominent posterior wall likely due to filling. Consider follow-up with a filled bladder or possibly (outpatient) urological evaluation.
