The report reveals a calculus approximately 6 x 3 x 4 mm in size located in the proximal left ureter, resulting in a Grade 2 hydronephrosis. No additional radiopaque calculi detected, and no hydronephrosis on the right side. There is a large cortical renal cyst at the upper pole of the left kidney, measuring about 5 cm. An axial hiatal hernia is present. As far as can be assessed natively, the parenchymal organs of the upper abdomen appear unremarkable. The included basal lung sections also appear unremarkable. No evidence of pathologically enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes. Notable arteriosclerosis, particularly infrarenal. Uncomplicated colonic diverticulosis. Degeneration of the hip joints, with no evidence of bone lesions suspicious for malignancy.
