Findings and Assessment:

Preoperative images from 09/23/2021 are available for comparison.

Chest:
- The heart appears enlarged. The upper mediastinum is widened with a new long-term shift of the trachea to the rightâ€”consider additional cross-sectional imaging.
- Mild pulmonary venous congestion. Blunted right hilum.
- No evidence of pneumothorax in the supine position.
- No significant pleural effusions.
- No evidence of pneumonic infiltrates.
- Bony thorax, as far as can be assessed with high-energy technique, is unremarkable.

Left Knee Joint:
- Comminuted fracture of the patella treated with two K-wires and tension band osteosynthesis. Hardware is in proper position and intact.
- Improved fragment alignment with a still discernible fracture zone and slight dorsal step-off.
- Normal alignment in the knee joint.
- Grade II gonarthrosis, more pronounced laterally.
