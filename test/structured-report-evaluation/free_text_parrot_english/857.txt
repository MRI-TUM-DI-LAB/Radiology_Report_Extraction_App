The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged and does not have a shape typical of valvular heart disease. Compared to previous imaging, there is a stable, extensive opacity in the left hilar region, consistent with the known tumor-atelectasis complex in the left upper lobe associated with NSCLC. Accompanying this, there is an unchanged narrow malignant pleural effusion on the left side. No pleural effusion on the right. No evidence of pneumonic infiltrates in the visible lung sections. No signs of pulmonary venous congestion. No evidence of a pneumothorax. Port catheter system from the left brachial region with the tip projecting at the cavoatrial junction. No evidence of displaced rib fractures. Soft tissue shadow appears unremarkable.
