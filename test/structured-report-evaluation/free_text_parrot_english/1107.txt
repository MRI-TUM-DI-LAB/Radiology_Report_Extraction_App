CT Thorax (without contrast)

Findings
There is a significant increase in ground-glass opacities (GGO) in the left upper and lower lobes as well as the lingula, with the development of scattered small consolidations. On the right side, there is a decrease in GGO in the upper lobe and initial regression of individual consolidations in the apical and anterior segments of the right upper lobe. However, the right lower lobe shows an increase in small consolidations with a predominantly bronchovascular distribution pattern. There is still no pleural effusion. The heart size is normal. Currently, there is no evidence of an inflammatory-pneumonic infiltrate. An unremarkable nasogastric tube is in place.

Impression
There is an increase in ground-glass infiltrates, particularly on the left side, now involving the entire left lung with the development of scattered small consolidations in the context of known ARDS. Similar changes are observed in the right lower lobe with an increase in GGO and small consolidations. There is regression of small consolidations in the right upper lobe with improved ventilation, although GGO is still detectable. Nasogastric tube.
