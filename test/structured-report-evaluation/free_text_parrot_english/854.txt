Unremarkable appearance of the basal lung parenchyma. No pleural effusions. No pericardial effusion. Homogeneous contrast enhancement of the liver parenchyma with no evidence of focal lesions. Free perfusion of the portal vein and hepatic veins. Unremarkable gallbladder. No evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic cholestasis. Unremarkable appearance of the pancreatic parenchyma. Mild splenomegaly (15 cm). Slim adrenal glands on both sides. Normal contrast uptake in the renal parenchyma on both sides with no signs of perfusion defects. Unremarkable appearance of the urinary tract with no signs of urinary obstruction. Fecal stasis. Likely status post ileocecal resection with a suture line present. Normal passage of orally and rectally administered contrast medium with no evidence of stenosing processes or leaks.
