Clinical Information, Question, Justification: Status post closure of the residual feeder of a cervical AV fistula. Postoperative DSA check requested.

Method: Puncture of the right common femoral artery after local anesthesia. 5F sheath, 5F vertebral catheter. Serial angiographies following selective probing of the common carotid arteries bilaterally and vertebral arteries bilaterally, including 3D rotational angiography of the right vertebral artery. Non-reactive manual intra-arterial contrast application of a total of 150 ml Imeron 300. Post-interventional manual compression of the puncture site followed by the application of a circular pressure bandage.

Technique: Biplane imaging technique, total DAP 4712.22 cGy x cm2, fluoroscopy time 11 minutes and 46 seconds.

Findings: Known ulcerating stenoses at the origins of the internal carotid arteries bilaterally, therefore visualization only from the common carotid arteries. Complete closure of the residual feeder at the level of C5/6. Consistent complete closure of the prominent distal feeder at the level of C3/4.

Conclusion: Uncomplicated DSA for postoperative control of an AV fistula from the V2 segment of the right vertebral artery. This demonstrated complete closure of the residual feeder at the level of C5/6.
