Following a previous puncture in the right inguinal region, there is evidence of a large inguinal hematoma and a retroperitoneal hematoma on the right side. There is evidence of active arterial bleeding with venous pooling, presumably originating from a small branch of the right external iliac artery. The pelvic organs included in the examination appear unremarkable. The bony structures also appear unremarkable.
