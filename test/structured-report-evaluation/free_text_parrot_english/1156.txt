Clinical Question: Evaluation of unclear upper abdominal symptoms, exclusion of pancreatic carcinoma  
Technique: MRI of the abdomen with and without contrast (Gadolinium) using T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and DWI sequences, MR.  
Previous Findings: CT of the abdomen from 09/17/2024.  
Findings: The abdominal MRI reveals a solid mass in the pancreatic head measuring approximately 3.5 x 2.8 x 3.0 cm. The mass appears hypointense on T1-weighted images and heterogeneously hyperintense on T2-weighted images. On the DWI sequence, the lesion shows restricted diffusion with high signal intensity. Post-contrast, there is inhomogeneous and delayed enhancement. The pancreatic duct is abruptly interrupted at the site of the mass, with significant dilation proximal to the stenosis. The bile ducts are also dilated, with the common bile duct measuring approximately 11 mm in diameter. The liver exhibits a homogeneous parenchymal structure with no focal lesions. The intrahepatic bile ducts are not dilated. The gallbladder is contracted and free of stones. The spleen, kidneys, and adrenal glands appear normal. There are no pathologically enlarged lymph nodes in the abdomen or retroperitoneum. No free fluid is present. The visualized bowel segments are unremarkable. The major abdominal vessels show no stenosis or aneurysms.  
Conclusion: The imaging findings demonstrate a mass in the pancreatic head with MRI characteristics typical of ductal adenocarcinoma. The abrupt interruption of the pancreatic duct and dilation of the bile ducts support this diagnosis. A solid pseudopapillary neoplasm cannot be definitively excluded based on imaging but is considered less likely.
