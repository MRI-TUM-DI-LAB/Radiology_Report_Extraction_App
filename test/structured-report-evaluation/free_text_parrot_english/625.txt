Known, persistent tuberculous spondylodiscitis at the L1/2 segment with destruction of the vertebral bodies. Surrounding abscess on the left is regressing with a percutaneous drainage in place from the dorsal side, currently approximately 3 x 3 cm residual. Mild surrounding infiltration of the adipose tissue and swelling of the paravertebral musculature. Additionally, the rest of the spine, as well as the included upper abdominal organs and basal lung sections, appear consistently unremarkable.
