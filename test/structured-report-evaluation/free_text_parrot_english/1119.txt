Clinical Question: Suspected older meniscal lesion, rule out cruciate ligament rupture  
Technique: MRI of the left knee joint in various sequences and planes.  
Findings: The anterior cruciate ligament appears continuous and intact in all sequences. The posterior cruciate ligament is also intact. The medial meniscus shows a horizontal tear in the posterior horn extending to the inferior surface. The lateral meniscus is intact. The cartilage surfaces of the femur and tibia are age-appropriate with no focal defects or abnormalities. There is a mild joint effusion. The collateral ligaments are intact. Muscles and tendons show no pathological changes. No Baker's cyst.  
Impression: Horizontal tear in the posterior horn of the left medial meniscus (Grade III). Mild joint effusion. No evidence of cruciate ligament injury or other pathological changes.
