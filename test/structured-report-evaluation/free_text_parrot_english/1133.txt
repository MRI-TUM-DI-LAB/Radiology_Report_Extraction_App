Clinical Question: Kidney cysts? Size and follow-up assessment  
Technique: CT of the abdomen without and with contrast in arterial and nephrographic phases.  
Previous Findings: CT of the abdomen from June 15, 2023: Multiple small kidney cysts on both sides.  
Findings: Both kidneys exhibit multiple small cysts, unchanged, with a maximum diameter of approximately 10 mm each. The cysts have smooth borders and show no wall thickening or septations. The kidneys are otherwise normal in size and position. The renal parenchyma is age-appropriate with no signs of scarring or focal lesions. Contrast medium is properly absorbed and excreted. No urinary obstruction. The urinary tract is unremarkable. Adrenal glands are unremarkable. No pathological lymph nodes in the retroperitoneum.  
Impression: Multiple small kidney cysts on both sides, stable compared to previous findings.
