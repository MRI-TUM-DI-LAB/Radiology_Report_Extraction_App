As previously known, there is evidence of 5 anchors in the humeral head between the greater and lesser tuberosity following rotator cuff repair. These remain unchanged in position compared to the prior examination from 2013. There is no indication of material failure. Compared to the previous examination (in the long-term follow-up since 2013), there is increasing osteoarthritis of the shoulder with progressively larger osteophytic formations on the superior glenoid (approximately 4 mm) and inferior humeral head (approximately 2 mm). There is also markedly progressive hypertrophic acromioclavicular joint arthritis with advancing ossicles at the greater tuberosity. Otherwise, the shoulder joint appears unremarkable. The included view of the hemithorax is unremarkable.
