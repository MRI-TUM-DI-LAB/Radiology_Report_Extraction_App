MRI of the Achilles Tendon

A spindle-shaped thickening of the Achilles tendon was already suggested on the X-ray. In the MRI, the short tendon diameter at the point of maximum thickening measures approximately 14 mm. The tendon substance shows signal-rich, mild alterations in TIRM, T2 FS, and T1 sequences, with the tendon surface and insertion remaining intact. There is no local bursitis or fluid collection. There are pronounced edematous infiltrations in the subcutaneous fat tissue, as well as edematous deposits in the Kager's fat pad and slightly edematous areas in the muscles, such as the flexor hallucis longus. There is a mild, patchy alteration of the bone marrow, consistent with immobilization, but no fracture line. The joints are congruent with only minimal fluid, and there is no evidence of arthritis. The plantar fascia and short flexor muscles are normal. The extensors are unremarkable. There is no damage to the peroneal tendons. The interosseous membrane and syndesmotic ligaments are normal, and the fibulotarsal ligaments are continuous. In the available planes, no discernible damage to the deltoid ligament complex is observed.

Assessment:
- Tendinosis of the Achilles tendon, with relatively minor signal alteration, no tear, and no acute bursitis.
- Edematous infiltrations in the subcutaneous fat and Kager's fat (clinically likely "edema").
- Suspected immobilization osteoporosis, differential diagnosis includes medication-induced effects without insufficiency fracture.
