MRI of the Brain

The interhemispheric fissure is of normal wiRXh. The lateral ventricles are symmetrical. Basal cisterns are well-defined. No evidence of cerebrospinal fluid circulation disturbance. DWI reveals a focal diffusion restriction (hyperintense on TRACE, mildly hypointense on ADC, demarcated on T2-weighted images) measuring 7x4mm in the left internal capsule and the tip of the globus pallidus. There is slight diffusion restriction in the left head of the caudate nucleus and the anterior third of the putamen. SWI shows no pathological susceptibility artifacts. T2 TIRM images show confluent microangiopathic changes periventricularly and subcortically. Paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well-aerated. Orbits are unremarkable.

Conclusion
Evidence of a subacute focal ischemia in the left internal capsule and the tip of the left globus pallidus, as well as, to a lesser extent, in the left head of the caudate nucleus and anterior putamen. Confluent microangiopathic leukoencephalopathy.
