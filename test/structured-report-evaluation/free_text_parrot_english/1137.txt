Question: Brain metastases?  
Technique: MRI of the brain with and without contrast (Gadolinium).  
Findings: In the right cerebral hemisphere, there is a ring-enhancing mass with surrounding edema. The mass measures approximately 2 cm in diameter and is located in the parietal lobe. No other significant masses are observed in the brain. Ventricles and sulci are not displaced or compressed.  
Conclusion: Solitary mass in the right parietal lobe with MRI characteristics suggestive of a metastasis.
