CT Head

The interhemispheric fissure is midline. The lateral ventricles are symmetrically displayed, with well-developed basal cisterns and no evidence of cerebrospinal fluid circulation disturbance. There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage. Normal gray-white matter differentiation is observed, with no newly demarcated infarct. No old parenchymal defects are present. There are no hypodensities in the white matter. No fractures of the skull base, skull vault, or midface are detected. The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well-aerated. The orbits appear unremarkable.
