Findings:  
There is an enlargement of the internal and external cerebrospinal fluid spaces. No evidence of hyperdense areas suggestive of bleeding or newly appearing hypodense regions. The basal cisterns at the foramen magnum are clearly visible. The differentiation between white and gray matter is preserved. There is calcification of the choroid plexus and pineal gland. No evidence of a skull cap fracture. There is a lobulated osteolytic lesion in the mid-occipital region with an intact outer table, differential diagnosis includes arachnoid granulation. The cervical spine shows a kyphotic alignment with moderate degenerative changes. Assessment is limited due to dental implants causing corresponding hardening artifacts. Dental occlusion appears normal as far as can be assessed. There is a slightly displaced fracture of the left nasal bone. Nodular goiter is present.

Conclusion:  
-No evidence of intracranial bleeding.  
-Slightly displaced fracture of the left nasal bone.
