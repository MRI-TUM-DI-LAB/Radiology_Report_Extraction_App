Clinical Question: Cervical disc herniation?

Technique: MRI of the cervical spine in various sequences and planes.

Findings: Age-appropriate degenerative changes of the cervical spine with spondylarthrosis and osteochondrosis at C5/6 and C6/7. At the C6/7 level, there is a central disc herniation with compression of the spinal cord. The spinal canal is significantly narrowed at this level. The neural foramina are clear.

Conclusion: Central disc herniation at C6/7 with spinal cord compression.
