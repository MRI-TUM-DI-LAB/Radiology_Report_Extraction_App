CT Angiography of the Aorta

FINDINGS
Clinical Information: Incidental finding of ascending aorta dilation, echocardiographically measured at over 6 cm, arterial hypertension. Question: Aorta dimensions.
First CT in-house.

Aorta:
The maximum diameter of the ascending aorta at the level of the pulmonary trunk, not axially reformatted, is approximately 6.4 cm. Supra-aortic vessel origins are unremarkable. The descending aorta and iliac vessels show no aneurysm or dissection. Throughout the entire aorta and iliac vessels, there are extensive hard and soft plaque formations without significant vascular narrowing. Calcifications are present at the origin of the aortic branches; the celiac trunk, SMA, and renal arteries on both sides, as well as the SMA, are patent.

Thorax:
No evidence of pathologically enlarged lymph nodes in the axillary, supraclavicular, or mediastinal regions. No pericardial effusion, no pleural effusion. Aortic valve calcification. Mitral annular calcification. Extensive coronary sclerosis. Pulmonary arteries are not enlarged. No pneumonic infiltrates. A calcified granuloma in the anterior segment of the left upper lobe. A 3 mm pulmonary nodule in the posterobasal segment of the left lower lobe, and a 4 mm pulmonary nodule in the laterobasal segment of the right lower lobe. The tracheobronchial system is clear as far as can be assessed. Ventilation disturbances in the lingula. Linear scarring changes in the mediobasal segment of the right lower lobe.

Abdomen:
Fat distribution disorder at the ligamentum teres hepatis. An 8 mm cyst in liver segment IVa. No other liver lesions in the early arterial phase. Gallbladder is unremarkable, no stones. The common bile duct is dilated to just under 1 cm. The pancreatic duct is just under 3 mm. Pancreatic parenchyma is unremarkable. Spleen is not enlarged. The left adrenal gland is plump, the right adrenal gland is slender. Normal corticomedullary differentiation of both kidneys, with multiple cortical renal cysts on both sides, the largest measuring approximately 5.7 cm on the right kidney. The bladder is collapsed, not assessable. Calcifications in the uterus. No free fluid in the pelvis as far as can be assessed due to hardening artifacts from the left hip replacement. Retroperitoneal lymph nodes are increased in number but not significantly enlarged; iliac lymph nodes are also not conspicuously enlarged. The gastrointestinal tract is not assessable. No free air, no intra-abdominal abscess.

Spine:
Extensive degenerative changes in the lumbar spine, erosive osteochondrosis in the disc spaces L1/2, L2/3, and L3/4. Extensive spondyloarthrosis of the lumbar spine, Baastrup's phenomenon. In the context of osteochondrosis, the endplate of L2 is almost completely destroyed, with 13 mm hypodense lesions in L2 and T12, consistent with a hemangioma. Old T12 fracture. Left hip replacement. Signs of coxarthrosis on the right. A round 18 mm demineralized area at the left acetabulum, visible in previous conventional examinations, consistent with a cyst.

IMPRESSION
Aneurysm of the ascending aorta measuring up to 6.4 cm, no dissection.
Overall extensive aortic sclerosis and sclerosis of the iliac vessels without significant vascular stenosis; visceral and renal arteries are patent.
Three pulmonary nodules, one calcified, with a maximum diameter of 4 mm, primarily consistent with granulomas.
Liver cyst in segment IVa.
Dilated common bile duct and slightly dilated pancreatic duct, no calcified stones, no mass in the pancreatic head visible.
Multiple cortical renal cysts on both sides, all Bosniak category 1.
Extensive degenerative changes in the spine, such as erosive osteochondrosis in the L2/3 disc space.
Old T12 fracture.
