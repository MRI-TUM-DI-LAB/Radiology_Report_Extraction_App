Clinical Information, Question, Justification: Known Crohn's disease, right-sided pain. Inflammation? Stenosis? 

Technique: Oral administration of 250 ml Osmofundin, intravenous administration of 2 ml Buscopan. 1.5-Tesla MRI of the abdomen with the following sequences: Localizer. Axial T2 Haste, Axial T1 Flash opp/in, Coronal T2 Haste, Sagittal T2 Haste, Coronal T2 Haste fat-saturated, post-contrast administration of 8 ml Gadovist T1 vibe fat-saturated coronal dynamic sequences, Axial T1 Flash fat-saturated, Coronal T1 Flash fat-saturated, Coronal T2 Haste fat-saturated, Coronal T2 TRUFI.

Findings: Approximately 7 cm long previously known wall thickening of the terminal ileum (Series 7, Images 45-48) without signal enhancement after contrast administration, no edema in the fat-saturated T2-weighted sequences. 4 cm proximally, there is a 2 cm long wall thickening of the ileum, and further 3 cm proximally, a 1 cm long wall thickening of the ileum (Series 7, Image 51), also without edema in the fat-saturated T2-weighted sequences, no post-contrast signal enhancement. No pathologically distended bowel loops. No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes. Small amount of free fluid in the pelvis, within physiological limits. Normal-sized, smoothly contoured liver, previously known cystic lesion in segment 4b. No dilation of intrahepatic or extrahepatic bile ducts. Normal lobulation of the pancreatic parenchyma without dilation of the pancreatic duct. Normal-sized spleen with homogeneous parenchyma, previously known 3 accessory spleens. Narrow adrenal glands on both sides. Normal-sized, orthotopically located kidneys on both sides, no urinary obstruction. Slightly fluid-filled bladder without wall irregularities. Anteverted uterus. Known Nabothian cysts of the cervix. No diffuse infiltrate in the basal lung. No basal pleural effusion or pericardial effusion. No pathological signal from the included osseous structures. Previously known slight ventrolisthesis of L4, Meyerding Grade I.

Conclusion: No active inflammation. Chronic inflammatory wall changes of the terminal ileum (approximately 7 cm) with two short-segment (also chronic) "skip lesions" in the proximal ileum. No pathological dilation of the bowel loops.
