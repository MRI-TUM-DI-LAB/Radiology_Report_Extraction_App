Clinical Information, Question, Justification for Examination: Request for visualization of TIPSS. 

Method: Ultrasound-guided puncture of the right internal jugular vein using the Seldinger technique and insertion of a 10 cm 8F sheath. Probing of the TIPSS tract with a 6F multipurpose catheter. Pressure measurement in the portal vein and the superior vena cava. Determination of the pressure gradient. Direct portography with 2x20 ml Xenetix 300. Sterile dressing.

Findings: No evidence of hemodynamically significant stenoses. Normal outflow conditions.

Pressure Measurement: 
Superior vena cava: 11 mmHg 
Portal vein: 14 mmHg 
This results in a normal pressure gradient of 3 mmHg (normal range 5-15 mmHg).

Conclusion: No stenosis detectable. Normal outflow conditions. No portal hypertension.
