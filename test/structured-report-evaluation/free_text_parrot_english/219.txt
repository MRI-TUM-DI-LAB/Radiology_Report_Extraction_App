Clinical Information, Question, Justification for Examination: Status post total extraperitoneal (TEP) repair of a right inguinal hernia. Query for hernia. 

Consent and Explanation: After taking a risk history, both oral and written explanations were provided regarding the contrast medium application, examination procedure, and potential risks (see also consent form). Written consent obtained from the patient.

Technique: Digital overview radiographs. Multislice CT of the abdomen in axial sections and venous contrast phase. Uncomplicated administration of 120 ml Xenetix-350. Multiplanar reconstruction. Dose-length product: 240 mGy.cm.

Findings and Assessment: No previous images available for comparison.

- Right inguinal hernia with prolapsed ileal loop including mesentery (approximately 6.3 x 3 cm in series 4 image 511 or series 4, image 484). Compared to the rest of the small intestine, the herniated loop shows slightly reduced contrast, differential diagnosis suggests possible incarceration.
- Infiltrated fatty tissue at the umbilical ring and adjacent to the rectus abdominis (series 4 image 334). Small amounts of free fluid in the surgical area.
- Liver and spleen are unremarkable. No intra- or extrahepatic cholestasis. Small accessory spleen (series 4 image 188). Pancreas shows typical lobulated structure.
- Kidneys show symmetrical contrast enhancement. Small cystic lesion in the right cortical lower pole of the right kidney, most likely a parapelvic cyst on the left. Accentuated renal pelvis and prominent ureter on the left, differential diagnosis suggests ascending urinary tract infection. Clinical correlation needed? The bladder appears wall-thickened with low filling state.
- No pathologically distended bowel loops. No free air and no free fluid.
- No abdominal lymphadenopathy.
- Unremarkable depiction of the included lower lung sections.
- Older appearing impression of the endplate of L5, likely degenerative. No evidence of osteodestruction suggestive of inflammation.
