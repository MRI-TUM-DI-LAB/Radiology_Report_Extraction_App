Findings:

The lower neck regions appear normal. The lung parenchyma is adjacent to the thoracic wall on all sides. There are subtle signs of congestion, with slightly prominent vessels and mild central ground-glass opacities. There is reduced aeration in the dorsobasal regions. There is global cardiomegaly, with hypertrophy of the left ventricular myocardium (septum approximately 14 mm). Calcification of the aortic and mitral valves is noted. Coronary sclerosis is present. The left main pulmonary artery is dilated to about 3.1 cm. There is a contrast filling defect in the right upper lobe artery, extending to the segmental level. The known compression fractures of T2 and T11 vertebrae show no clear evidence of further collapse compared to the previous examination. There is no evidence of pathologically enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinal, hilar, or axillary regions.

Impression:
- Evidence of a pulmonary embolism in the right upper lobe artery with segmental extension. No evidence of acute right heart strain, with marked left ventricular hypertrophy and mild pulmonary venous congestion.
- The previously known vertebral fractures as described above, without any apparent further collapse.
