CT Chest

No effusion. Known pulmonary tuberculosis with lesions in the following locations: Large thick-walled cavity in the apical segment of the right lower lobe, with a maximum diameter of 5.5 cm, and slight retraction of the oblique interlobar fissure. The lesion is slightly reduced in size and more sharply demarcated compared to previous imaging. Satellite lesions slightly caudal, currently with a maximum of 9 mm compared to 13 mm previously, also show slight regression. Additional lesions are found dorsobasally on the right, subpleural, and cavitary, significantly regressed in the apical lower lobe on the left, as well as an extensive cavity in the posteroapical region of the right upper lobe. In the latter lesion, the perifocal infiltrations show significant regression. A pre-existing peribronchial consolidation in the dorsobasal right lower lobe is largely regressed, with only a minimal residual finding of 7 mm. No evidence of new lesions.

The hilar lymph nodes are slightly accentuated and overall regressed, exemplified by the paratracheal nodes on the right. Aorta is of normal caliber. Minimal aortic calcification. Moderate coronary calcification. The pulmonary arterial system is normally perfused. No pericardial effusion. Partially visualized upper abdomen with slender adrenal glands. Upper abdominal organs appear normal in the given contrast phase. Thyroid is not enlarged. Axillary regions are free of lymphadenopathy.

Impression

No evidence of pulmonary embolism. Known pulmonary tuberculosis with cavitary lesions in the right upper lobe, right apical lower lobe, and left lower lobe. Regressing mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Moderate coronary sclerosis.
