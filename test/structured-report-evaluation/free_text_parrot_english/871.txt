Evidence of a T2-hyperintense cystic lesion located dorsally to the knee joint, situated medially between the semimembranosus muscle and the medial head of the gastrocnemius muscle. No evidence of signal voids typical of bleeding within the cystic lesion. The lesion has a maximum sagittal dimension of approximately 9 x 4 cm. Isolated pinpoint signal voids in the T2* sequence in the posterior knee joint. Thinned appearance of the posterior horn of the medial meniscus. Joint effusion. Markedly thickened appearance and contrast-enhanced depiction of the synovium throughout the knee joint. Cartilage damage of the medial femoral condyle with a small adjacent bone marrow edema. In the STIR sequence, hyperintense depiction of the bone marrow of the patella indicative of edema. Joint effusion.
