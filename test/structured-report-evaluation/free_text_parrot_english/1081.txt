CT Wrist / Hand

Findings and Assessment
The anchor (micro Corkscrew) in the lunate bone remains unchanged compared to previous imaging, inserted from the dorsal side following fixation/reinsertion of the DIC onto the posterior horn of the lunate and the dorsal SL ligament. Known osseous cysts in the lunate bone are visible on fluoroscopy images, with one located near the tip of the anchor. No signs of loosening are observed otherwise. 
Harmonious articulation at the distal radioulnar joint and the wrist joint.
Normal SL distance, with no signs of degeneration.
Compact bone island in the trapezium.
Due to technical limitations (low-dose examination, no intra-articular contrast), the ligaments and other soft tissues cannot be assessed in detail, with mild imbibition of the subcutaneous fat tissue on the dorsal wrist.
