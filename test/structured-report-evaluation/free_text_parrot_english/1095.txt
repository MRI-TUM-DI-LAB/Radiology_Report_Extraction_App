CT Paranasal Sinuses

Findings and Impression

The frontal sinuses are completely occluded on both sides. There is partial occlusion of the ethmoid air cells. There is significant polypoid mucosal swelling/retention cysts in the maxillary sinuses bilaterally. The right ostiomeatal complex is obstructed, while the left is patent. There is minimal secretion in the right sphenoid sinus (the left is hypoplastic). The mastoid air cells are well-aerated. There is no significant sclerosis of the bony sinus margins, and no evidence of chronic remodeling. The nasal septum shows no major lateral deviation. The olfactory groove measures up to 5mm (Keros Type II). The root of tooth 26 extends into the maxillary sinus. There is no apical periodontitis. As far as can be assessed with low-dose technique, the included brain parenchyma appears unremarkable. Incidental finding of a metopic suture.
