Clinical Information, Question, Justification: PAD stage 4 on the left. Request for improvement of pelvic vessel condition. Methodology and Findings: CT scan from 07/12/24 for comparison. Supine position. Skin disinfection. Sterile draping. Local anesthesia. Smooth, ultrasound-guided retrograde puncture of the right CFA using a micropuncture set and placement of a short 4F sheath. Intra-arterial administration of 5000 units of heparin. Placement of a 4F pigtail catheter in the infrarenal abdominal aorta. Imaging using DSA technique. Ultrasound-guided, smooth retrograde puncture of the left CFA and placement of a short 6F sheath. Exchange of the right 4F sheath for a 6F sheath. Careful stent PTA using kissing technique at the aortic bifurcation (two 12 x 60 mm E-Luminexx Vascular Stents). Extension of the right-sided stent into the pre-existing external iliac artery stent (10 x 40 mm ASTRON Biotronik). Final imaging shows rapid distal runoff, with proximal occlusion of the left SFA and collateral refilling of the distal SFA. High-grade calcified stenoses of the right CFA. Removal of materials. Closure system on both sides (6/7F Mynx, Control). Pressure bandage. Conclusion: Successful implantation of kissing stents at the aortic bifurcation.
