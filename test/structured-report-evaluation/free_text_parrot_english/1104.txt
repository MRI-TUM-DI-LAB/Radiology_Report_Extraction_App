Findings

There is evidence of a contrast-enhancing mass in the left renal pelvis at the junction of the pyeloureteral segment, involving the proximal ureteral ostium, measuring 15x10x18mm, with corresponding enhancement in the delayed phase. Currently, there is no hydronephrosis. Symmetrical contrast enhancement of the kidneys, with slender renal pelvis and ureter origins. A small parenchymal renal lesion on the left, measuring 7mm, is too small to characterize.

The bladder is moderately filled and shows strong contrast enhancement in the delayed phase, though not completely in the ventral portion. On the right side, there is a bladder diverticulum measuring 30x10mm with a narrow neck, which shows strong contrast enhancement in the delayed phase, though not completely in the ventral portion. There is a small protrusion at the anterolateral corner of the bladder associated with a known fat-containing right inguinal hernia. The prostate has a transverse diameter of 4.8cm. The seminal vesicles are nearly symmetrical.

The basal lungs show no pleural effusion or infiltrate. There is a known unchanged consolidation of the lung parenchyma in the lingular segment. A known unchanged peripheral nodule in the dorsobasal right lung, measuring 5mm, appears benign over time. No pericardial effusion. A small hiatal hernia is present. The liver texture is homogeneous. There are three unchanged hemangiomas in segments 8, 7, and 6 of the liver. No liver lesions are noted over time. No dilation of the bile ducts. The gallbladder is unremarkable. The pancreas shows no ductal dilation, surrounding reaction, or focal lesion. No adrenal masses. The spleen texture is homogeneous. No ascites. No pneumoperitoneum.

An unchanged mediastinal lymph node measures 8mm in short axis. No suspiciously enlarged lymph nodes in the abdominal, pelvic, or inguinal regions.

There is unremarkable diverticulosis throughout the colon, particularly in the sigmoid and descending colon, without evidence of surrounding reaction. A small, unremarkable jejunal diverticulum is noted. The gastrointestinal tract shows no segmental abnormal distension. The aorta shows homogeneous contrast enhancement in the given contrast phase. The portal vein and its tributaries show homogeneous contrast enhancement. There is an anatomical variant of the venous vessels with an enlarged left lumbar vein measuring 6mm, draining into the left renal vein posteriorly. Singular renal arteries are present on both sides. The abdominal wall is approximately symmetrical. There is evidence of an unremarkable, slightly right-sided fat-containing umbilical hernia measuring 50x40mm. A right-sided fat-containing inguinal hernia is present.

The alignment of the visualized vertebral bodies is intact. There is a slight right-convex scoliotic posture. Degenerative changes are noted at L5/S1 with a vacuum phenomenon. No suspicious osseous lesions are identified.

Impression

There is evidence of a contrast-enhancing mass in the proximal left renal pelvis at the junction of the pyeloureteral segment, involving the proximal ureteral ostium, measuring 15x10x18mm (measured sagittally and axially). Currently, there is no hydronephrosis. A small parenchymal renal lesion on the left, measuring 7mm, is too small to characterize. No suspiciously enlarged lymph nodes in the abdominal, pelvic, or inguinal regions on the right side.
