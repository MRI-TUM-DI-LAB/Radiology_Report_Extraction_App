Findings:  
Ultrasound reveals prominently structured and highly vascularized glandular tissue in the lactating breast, considered physiological. Consistent with the previous examination, the smallest cyst is noted in the upper central left area. The hypoechoic, smoothly bordered lesion in the upper outer left area has slightly decreased from 3mm to 1-2mm. Newly observed since the last examination are smoothly bordered lesions near the nipple with posterior acoustic enhancement, located at 9 o'clock on the right with a maximum diameter of 7mm, and at 11 o'clock on the left with a maximum diameter of 6mm. No evidence of newly developed solid suspicious lesions. No suspicious axillary lymphadenopathy.

Conclusion:  
No indication of malignancy. Newly observed since the last examination are bilateral cystic lesions near the nipple at 9 o'clock on the right and 11 o'clock on the left, likely due to current lactation, differential diagnosis includes cysts or duct ectasia.
