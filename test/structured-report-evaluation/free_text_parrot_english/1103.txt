Right Knee

There is a small joint effusion with increased fluid in the lateral recess, but no capsular hyperemia. A 1.4 x 1 x 1.5 cm Baker's cyst is noted posteromedially in the popliteal fossa, with fine septations and no hyperemia. The patient is currently asymptomatic, with no tenderness on pressure in this area (recurrent leakage could be a possible cause of pain).
