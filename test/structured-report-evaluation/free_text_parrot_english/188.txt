Clinical Information, Question: Painful osteoarthritis of the right knee. Immobilizing pain. Symptomatic treatment via joint artery embolization desired. Individual treatment attempt due to refusal of knee replacement surgery and exhausted conventional therapy. Methodology and Findings: Multiple prior examinations, most recent on 12/05/23. Supine position. Skin disinfection. Sterile draping. Local anesthesia. Ultrasound-guided, smooth antegrade puncture of the right common femoral artery using a micropuncture set and placement of a 4F sheath (BriteTip). Catheterization of the right superficial femoral artery using a 3.3F JR 1.0 catheter (PediVascular). Overview imaging with DSA, showing a slight contrast medium blush at the medial femoral condyle. Selective catheterization of the corresponding genicular arteries with a microguidewire (0.014 Fathom) and microcatheter (1.7F Echelon). Imaging with DSA technique demonstrating contrast medium blush, cautious superselective, temporary particle embolization using a crystalline imipenem/cilastatin mixture (500 mg in 10 ml Imeron-300). Final check. Normal three-vessel supply to the lower leg. Removal of materials. Manual compression. Pressure bandage. Intra-arterial administration of 2000 IU heparin. Assessment: Technically successful transarterial, periarticular embolization of the right knee joint.
