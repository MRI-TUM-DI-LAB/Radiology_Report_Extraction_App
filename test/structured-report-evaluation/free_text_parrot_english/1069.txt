CT Angiography of Intra- and Extracranial Vessels:

The origin of the cerebral vessels is normal. There is appropriate contrast enhancement of the common carotid arteries on both sides, with atherosclerotic plaque formation at the level of the bifurcation. The Circle of Willis appears unremarkable. There is normal contrast enhancement of the vertebral arteries on both sides. The left transverse sinus is incompletely visualized, most likely corresponding to hypoplasia.

Conclusion:
Unremarkable appearance of the intra- and extracranial vessels supplying the brain.
