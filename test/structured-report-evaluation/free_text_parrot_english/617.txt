Approximately 4.5 cm mass encircling the left larynx with significant narrowing of the hypopharynx, laryngeal cavity, and proximal trachea. Extensive infiltration of the surrounding laryngeal musculature, with differentiation of the soft tissue structure not reliably possible due to accompanying soft tissue edema. 
No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes.
Paranasal sinuses included in the scan are well-aerated.
Homogeneous thyroid parenchyma.
Unremarkable appearance of the included portions of the thorax.
