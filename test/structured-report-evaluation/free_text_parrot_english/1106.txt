CT Thorax

No central or segmental pulmonary embolism detected; subsegmental embolism cannot be ruled out due to breathing artifacts, but at least no embolism in the lateral middle lobe. Signs of heart failure with enlarged pulmonary arteries (right 3.4 cm, left 3 cm), septal shift to the right, contrast reflux into the hepatic veins, thickened interlobar septa, and extensive pleural effusions on both sides (right 7 cm, left 5.8 cm rim). Adjacent compressive atelectasis. Bullous changes in the oblique interlobar fissure on the right. Partially ground-glass opacities in the upper lung sections due to centrilobular emphysema (differential diagnosis: cardiac). No acinar infiltrate. No significant pericardial effusion. Peribronchial cuffing. Central airways are patent. In the given contrast phase, at least accentuated hilar lymph nodes, no detectable enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. No evidence of focal lesions in the included portions of the upper abdominal organs. Uncomplicated cholecystolithiasis. Blunted left adrenal gland. Axial hiatal hernia. Aortic sclerosis. Coronary and valvular sclerosis. Intact alignment of the visualized spine. No suspicious osseous lesion. Primary bone island in vertebral body T12.

Assessment

Due to partial breathing artifacts, only a subsegmental pulmonary embolism in the lateral middle lobe is detected. No central or segmental pulmonary embolism in the presence of signs of cardiopulmonary decompensation with extensive pleural effusions, ventricular septal shift to the left, and contrast reflux into the hepatic veins. No apparent lung infiltrate. Marked coronary and valvular sclerosis, aortic sclerosis.
