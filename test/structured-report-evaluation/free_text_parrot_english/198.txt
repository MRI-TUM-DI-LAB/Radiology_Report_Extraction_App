Clinical Information, Question, Justification for Examination: Patient with recurrent pneumothoraces and an indwelling pleural drain. Follow-up requested. Findings and Assessment: Multiple prior images are available for comparison, most recently a chest CT from 10/26/2026. 
• Heart and upper mediastinum are slender. No pulmonary venous congestion. 
• Scarring changes in the lung framework and bullous emphysema. No evidence of pneumothorax under these conditions. 
• Small, stable pleural effusion on the right. No pleural effusion on the left. 
• Reduced aeration of the middle lobe and left lower lobe. 
• Consistent presence of a pleural drain on the right, with the tip located in the basal right lower lobe. 
• Bony thorax appears unremarkable as far as can be assessed with high-energy technique.
