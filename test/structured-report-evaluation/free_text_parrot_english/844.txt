Findings:

There is significant enlargement of the internal and external cerebrospinal fluid spaces, particularly a massive enlargement of the fourth ventricle associated with advanced cerebellar atrophy. There is a megacisterna magna. No evidence of hyperdense areas suggestive of bleeding or newly appearing hypodense regions. The differentiation between white and gray matter is preserved. The basal cisterns are clearly visible. There is mucosal swelling in both maxillary sinuses (more on the right than the left). Mucosal thickening is also present in the sphenoid sinus and ethmoid air cells. Both eyeballs are normally configured. There is reduced pneumatization of the mastoid cells on both sides. Increased sclerosis in the right mastoid, same as before. Partially captured older nasal bone fracture, same as before. No evidence of a fracture in the neurocranium. Contusion mark on the right frontal area.

Impression:
-No evidence of intracranial bleeding. Contusion mark on the right frontal area.
-No evidence of bony trauma sequelae.
-Acute sinusitis.
