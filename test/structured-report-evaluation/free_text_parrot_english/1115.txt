CTA Thorax-Abdomen

Findings
Vessels: Acute Type A aortic dissection involving the aortic valve, brachiocephalic trunk, right common carotid artery, extending distally to the right common iliac artery. The ascending thoracic aorta is dilated up to 4 cm. Coronary arteries are not involved. The celiac trunk, superior mesenteric artery (SMA), inferior mesenteric artery (IMA), and left renal artery originate from the true lumen. The right renal artery originates from the false lumen, resulting in hypoperfusion of the right kidney during the arterial phase. In the portal venous phase, there is equal perfusion of both kidneys. No pericardial effusion. No significant pleural effusion on either side.
Thorax: No pneumonic infiltrates. No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes in the axillary, periclavicular, mediastinal, or hilar regions on either side.
Abdomen: Liver and spleen are of normal size with no focal lesions detected. No dilation of the bile ducts. Gallbladder is unremarkable. Pancreas shows no ductal dilation, surrounding reaction, or focal lesions. No adrenal masses. No dilation of the renal collecting systems. No ascites. No pneumoperitoneum. No abdominopelvic lymphadenopathy.

The alignment of the visualized vertebral bodies is intact. Moderate degenerative changes are noted.

Assessment
Type A aortic dissection involving the aortic valve, brachiocephalic trunk, right common carotid artery, extending distally to the right common iliac artery. Coronary arteries are not involved. For a conclusive assessment of the distal involvement of the right common carotid artery, an additional CT of the extracranial neck vessels is recommended for further evaluation. All visceral arteries, except for the right renal artery, originate from the true lumen, which is compressed by the false lumen.
