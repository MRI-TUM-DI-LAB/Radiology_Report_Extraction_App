CT of the Neurocranium with CT Venography

The interhemispheric fissure is midline. The lateral ventricles are symmetrically displayed. The basal cisterns are well-defined. There is no indication of cerebrospinal fluid circulation disturbance. As far as can be assessed by CT, the infratentorial structures appear normal. The differentiation between the white and gray matter and the basal ganglia region is normal. There are no early signs of ischemia. No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage. Post-contrast, the dural sinuses and deep cerebral veins show normal enhancement. The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well-aerated. The orbits are unremarkable.

Impression
No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or a newly demarcated territorial infarct.
No dural sinus or deep cerebral vein thrombosis.
No evidence of sinusitis.
