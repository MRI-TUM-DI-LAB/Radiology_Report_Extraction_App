Clinic, Question, Justifying Indication:Patient with bilateral renal colic and microhematuria. Calculus?The justifying indication for the use of ionizing radiation was provided by the responsible, qualified physician.
Examination Technique:Digital overview radiographs. Native acquisition of the abdomen/pelvis using low-dose technique. Multiplanar reconstructions. Dose-length product 110.70 mGy*cm.
Findings:An external CT of the abdomen and pelvis from 09.01.2023 is available for comparison.
The liver has smooth edges and shows no evidence of focal lesions on native imaging. The gallbladder is thin-walled, fluid-filled, and without radiodense stones. No dilation of the intrahepatic or extrahepatic bile ducts. The pancreas is typically lobulated, with no dilation of the pancreatic duct. The spleen is not enlarged. Both adrenal glands are slim. The kidneys are orthotopically positioned. A 4 mm calculus is present at the left ureteral orifice. Moderate dilation of the left ureter and the left renal pelvis-calyx system, corresponding to Grade II hydronephrosis. No calculus in the right renal pelvis-calyx system or right ureter. No hydronephrosis on the right side. The urinary bladder is fluid-filled and without focal wall thickening. The prostate shows some calcifications. No pathologically distended small or large bowel loops. No free air or fluid. No pathologically enlarged or configured intra-abdominal or inguinal lymph nodes as far as can be assessed natively. No pneumonic infiltrates in the included basal lung sections. No osseous lesions suspicious for malignancy. Beginning degenerative changes in the spine. No fresh fractures.
Conclusion:4 mm calculus at the left ureteral orifice with consequent Grade II hydronephrosis on the left side.No calculus in the right renal pelvis-calyx system or ureter, no hydronephrosis on the right side.
