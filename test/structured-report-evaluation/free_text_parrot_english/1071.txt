The interhemispheric fissure is midline. The lateral ventricles are symmetrical. The basal cisterns and foramen magnum are unremarkable. No evidence of cerebrospinal fluid circulation disturbance. No acute intracranial hemorrhage. No early signs of ischemia, with normal gray-white matter differentiation and symmetrical delineation of the basal ganglia. There is a lacunar defect in the right frontal region. The orbits are symmetrical. The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well-aerated on both sides. No apical periodontal disease. There is a non-displaced, comminuted fracture at the subcapital region of the right mandible. No other fractures of the skull cap, midfacial bones, skull base, or the included upper cervical spine.
