CT Head and Neck

Findings
No relevant prior imaging available for comparison. 
Bilateral mucus retention cysts in the maxillary sinuses. Minimal secretion in the right maxillary sinus and right sphenoid sinus, with remodeling of the left maxillary sinus walls. Bilateral obstruction of the ostiomeatal complex. Partially obstructed ethmoid air cells on both sides. The remaining paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well-aerated on both sides. The nasal septum shows no significant lateral deviation, with a septal spur to the left. Normal olfactory groove depth up to 7 mm (Keros Type II). No relevant anatomical variants.
No apical periodontitis. Symmetrical and unremarkable orbits. Brain sections appear unremarkable as far as can be assessed in this low-dose native scan. The skull vault and included upper cervical spine sections are unremarkable.

Impression
Signs of chronic maxillary sinusitis on both sides with current mucus retention cysts bilaterally. Bilateral obstruction of the ostiomeatal complex.
