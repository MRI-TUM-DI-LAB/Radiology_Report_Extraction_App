MRI of the Cervical Spine

The cervical spine consists of seven vertebrae. There is a normal lordotic curvature and preserved alignment. No vertebral body height loss is observed. Signs of active spondyloarthrosis are present at the C4/5 level on the right. There is acute edematous osteochondrosis intervertebralis at the T4/5 level, with no other vertebral bodies showing pathological signal changes. There is only a slight broad-based disc protrusion at the C5/6 level without significant narrowing of the anterior or posterior subarachnoid space and without compression or displacement of the spinal cord. No myelopathy is noted. There is mild narrowing of the neural foramina at C5 on the right and C6 on the left, with no other foraminal nerve root compression. The included cervical soft tissues and basal brain sections appear normal.

Impression

Active spondyloarthrosis at C4/5 on the right. Acute edematous osteochondrosis intervertebralis at T4/5. Only slight broad-based disc protrusions, with the most pronounced at C5/6, overall without absolute spinal canal stenosis and without myelopathy. Mild narrowing of the neural foramina at C5 on the right and C6 on the left. No involvement of C7.
