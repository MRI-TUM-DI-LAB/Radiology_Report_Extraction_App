Clinical Information, Question, Justification: Glioblastoma WHO Grade IV. Recurrence/Progression? New lesions? 

Technique: MRI of the head at 1.5 T: Scout. Axial T2 TSE with fat saturation, Axial T2 Flash Hemo, Axial DWI with ADC mapping, Coronal T2 TIRM dark-fluid, Axial T1 Flash pre- and post-contrast (8.5 ml Gadovist i.v.) with subtraction, Sagittal T1-MPRAGE with reconstructions.

Findings: Comparison with previous MRI scans. Over time, there is a stable resection cavity in the left temporal region communicating with the left lateral ventricle, with extensive white matter gliosis extending from the left temporal to parietal/occipital regions. In the short term, there is stable, and in the long term, regressing nodular contrast enhancement at the mediocaudal margin (Se16/Im77-84). Since the last MRI, a newly appeared, now stable, pinpoint enhancement in the left thalamus (Se. 15 Img. 108). In the last MRI, a newly appeared and now stable faintly enhancing lesion in the left corpus callosum with adjacent stable edema. No pathological diffusion restriction. No pathological susceptibility artifacts in the hemo sequence. No midline shift or herniation. Basal cisterns, including the cerebellopontine angle, are clearly visible. No acute cerebrospinal fluid obstruction. Normal appearance of the pituitary and pineal glands. Orbits are normal on both sides. Preserved T2-weighted flow void of the major intracranial blood vessels. Status post osteoplastic craniotomy in the left temporal region with level coverage, the remaining bony neurocranium is unremarkable. Mastoid air cells and paranasal sinuses are aerated.

Conclusion: Over the long term, stable appearance of the nodular enhancement at the margin of the resection cavity. In the short term, stable appearance of newly appeared lesions in the left thalamus and left corpus callosum in the last examination. No new lesions suspicious for malignancy.
