Clinic, Question, Justifying Indication:Patient with worsening of a pre-existing left leg paresis since yesterday. Indication of re-infarction? Bleeding?The justifying indication for the use of ionizing radiation was provided by the responsible, qualified physician.
Examination Technique:Digital overview radiographs. Native incremental CT of the neurocranium. Multiplanar reconstructions. Dose-length product 800.40 mGy*cm.
Findings:Multiple previous examinations are available for comparison.
No hyperdensities suggestive of bleeding. No early signs of ischemia. No demarcating territorial infarct. Known old defect areas in the right occipital, right parietal, and right frontal precentral regions. Consistent mild asymmetry of the lateral ventricles, favoring the right side. Midline interhemispheric fissure. Basal cisterns are well delineated and not narrowed. No indication of a space-occupying lesion on native imaging. No skull cap fracture. Mild hyperostosis interna frontalis. As far as included, the paranasal sinuses and mastoid cells are well aerated, without fluid levels or mucosal swelling.
Conclusion:No intracranial bleeding. No fresh or demarcating ischemia. Multiple old infarct areas.
