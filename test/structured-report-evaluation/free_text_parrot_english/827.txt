Chest:
Emphysematous changes in the lung structure with a centrilobular distribution. Lung parenchyma is adjacent to the thoracic wall throughout. No evidence of suspicious intrapulmonary nodules. Pathologically enlarged lymph nodes in region 11R measuring approximately 1.4 cm in short-axis diameter and 10R measuring 1.2 cm in short-axis diameter. Additional prominent lymph nodes in multiple mediastinal regions, all measuring less than 1 cm in short-axis diameter.

Abdomen/Pelvis:
Liver parenchyma is well-defined. Hypodense liver lesion in segment II/IVa, differential diagnosis includes a cyst. Kidneys show symmetrical contrast enhancement. Spleen is not enlarged. Mass in the left adrenal gland with a maximum diameter of 3.1 cm and negative density values around -10, morphologically consistent with an adenoma. No evidence of free fluid or free air. Crescent-shaped thrombus distal to the origin of the inferior mesenteric artery with compression of the aortic lumen. Evidence of a contrast-enhanced outpouching measuring approximately 0.9 x 0.7 cm at the same location. No evidence of pathologically enlarged lymph nodes below the diaphragm.

Skeleton:
Osteochondrosis at L5/S1. Advanced degenerative changes of the spine.

Impression:
-Suspected penetrating aortic ulcer (PAU) of the infrarenal aorta, immediately distal to the origin of the inferior mesenteric artery (depth 0.9 cm, wiRXh 0.7 cm).
-Pathologically enlarged lymph nodes in regions 11 and 10 R, differential diagnosis includes reactive changes. Otherwise, no imaging evidence of infectious/inflammatory changes in the chest or abdomen.
-Incidental finding of a mass in the left adrenal gland with a maximum diameter of 3.1 cm and negative Hounsfield unit values, consistent with an adrenal adenoma.
