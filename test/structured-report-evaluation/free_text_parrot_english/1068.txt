CT Head

Moderate reduction in brain volume. Midline interhemispheric fissure. Symmetrically depicted lateral ventricles, open basal cisterns, no evidence of cerebrospinal fluid circulation disturbance. No acute intracranial hemorrhage. No newly demarcated infarct. Mild white matter hypodensities in the frontoparietal region, more pronounced on the right. No fracture of the skull base, calvarium, or midface. Paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well-aerated. Orbits are unremarkable.

Impression

No acute intracranial hemorrhage, no newly demarcated territorial infarct, no mass effect. Mild microangiopathic leukoencephalopathy, a small lacunar ischemia may be obscured.
