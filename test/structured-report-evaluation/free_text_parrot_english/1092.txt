MRI Lumbar Spine without Contrast

Findings
The lumbar spine consists of five vertebrae. Alignment is intact. No reduction in vertebral body height. The conus medullaris terminates at the level of L1, with no evidence of myelopathy. Disc dehydration is noted at L3/4 and L4/5. No significant abnormalities in the included retroperitoneal area. Normal trophic condition of the paraspinal muscles.

L3/4: Broad-based disc protrusion with annular tear. No recess, foraminal, or spinal canal stenosis. Mild facet joint arthrosis. L4/5: Broad-based disc protrusion with annular tear. No recess, foraminal, or spinal canal stenosis. Mild facet joint arthrosis, more pronounced on the left. L5/S1: Broad-based disc protrusion. No recess, foraminal, or spinal narrowing. Mild facet joint arthrosis, more pronounced on the left.

Impression
Disc protrusions from L3/4 to L5/S1, with annular tears at L3/4 and L4/5. No recess, foraminal, or spinal canal stenosis. Multisegmental mild facet joint arthrosis without signs of activation.
