MRI SHOULDER

Bones/Cartilage/Articulation: Glenohumeral osteoarthritis and AC joint arthritis. Small subchondral cysts at the superior margin of the greater tuberosity, at the insertion of the rotator cuff muscles. No bone marrow edema. Superficial irregularities of the glenohumeral cartilage surface, no deep defects. Intact labrum. Type II acromion according to Bigliani. No os acromiale. The acromiohumeral distance is 6.7 mm.

Bicipitolabral Complex/Glenohumeral Ligaments: Buford complex. Significant labral degeneration with a possible intralabral tear anterior to the labrum-biceps complex; additionally, the biceps pulley is swollen and heterogeneous. The biceps tendon is visualized in the intertubercular groove with moderate fluid in the sheath. SGHL and MGHL are intact. IGHL is not clearly delineable.

Rotator Cuff: Trans-tendinous rupture of the supraspinatus tendon with retraction of the tendon to the level of the humeral head (Patte 2). Tendinosis of the subscapularis tendon. Tendinosis of the infraspinatus tendon without a clearly delineable defect. Intact appearance of the teres minor tendon. Mild fatty infiltration in the rotator cuff muscles (Goutallier 1). Positive tangent sign. Small amount of fluid in the subacromial/subdeltoid bursa.

Impression:
Trans-tendinous rupture of the supraspinatus tendon.
Significant labral degeneration with a possible intralabral tear anterior to the labrum-biceps complex.
Tendinosis of the subscapularis and supraspinatus tendons. Tenosynovitis of the biceps tendon.
Glenohumeral osteoarthritis with AC joint arthritis.
