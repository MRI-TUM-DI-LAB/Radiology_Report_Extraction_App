Findings:  
The supine image is rotated incorrectly. There is an indwelling atrial catheter for VA-ECMO. Compared to the previous examination, there is a lack of vascular markings in the left upper and mid lung fields, with suspicion of a delineated pneumothorax line and a pleural dehiscence of approximately 4 cm. There is a suspected displaced fracture of the 4th rib on the left side. Soft tissue emphysema is noted lateral to the caudal rib cage. Moderate degenerative changes of the spine are present. There is a slight increase in markings in the right lung.

Impression:  
Progressive left-sided pneumothorax, with evidence of a displaced fracture of the 4th rib and adjacent caudal soft tissue emphysema.
