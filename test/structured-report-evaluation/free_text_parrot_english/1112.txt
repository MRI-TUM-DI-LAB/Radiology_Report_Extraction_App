CT NECK

FINDINGS

The thyroid gland is symmetrical. The nasopharynx, oropharynx, and hypopharynx appear normal with symmetrically preserved fat planes. The supraglottic and subglottic larynx are unremarkable. The parotid and submandibular glands are symmetrical. The masticatory and floor of mouth muscles are symmetrically visualized. The thyroid gland is of normal size without focal lesions. There is homogeneous contrast enhancement of the cerebral vessels without any stenosis at the origin or significant stenosis along their course. No suspiciously enlarged cervical lymph nodes are noted. The partially imaged brain sections show no acute or relevant pathology. There is a small mucus retention cyst in the left maxillary sinus with minimal secretion attachment; otherwise, the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well-aerated. The dorsal and ventral alignment of the visualized vertebral bodies is maintained. There is no reduction in vertebral body height. No degenerative changes are observed.
