Findings:

Partially visualized cystic mass in the right thyroid lobe. Lung parenchyma is adjacent to the thoracic wall throughout. Moderate respiratory artifacts, particularly in the basal lung sections. Ground-glass opacities with early consolidation in the lower lobes, more pronounced centrally and dorsally. Ubiquitous thickening of the interlobular septa. No evidence of contrast filling defects in the pulmonary arteries. No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum, hila, or axillary regions. Enlarged anteroposterior diameter of the atrium measuring approximately 5.3 cm. Enlarged left ventricle measuring approximately 6 cm. Stomach lumen is notably filled with secretions. Moderate degenerative changes in the spine.

Impression:
-Centrally pronounced ground-glass opacities with thickening of the interlobular septa, consistent with alveolar pulmonary edema. Given the dilation of the left atrium and ventricle, a cardiac origin is suspected.
-Incidental finding of a partially visualized cystic mass in the right thyroid lobe. Further evaluation is recommended if not already performed.
