Ultrasound of the Achilles Tendon

Pain point located 2.5 cm proximal to the insertion, with a slightly thickened tendon (anterior-posterior diameter 11-12 mm) and hypoechoic thickening of the paratenon, along with subcutaneous fluid accumulation more pronounced medially than laterally. Doppler ultrasound shows focal hyperemia medially adjacent to the tendon and within the deeper portions. No discontinuity observed, and no gap detected during active/passive flexion/extension. A small posterior heel spur is present at the calcaneal insertion, with an unremarkable and intact appearance of the tendons, showing no signs of hyperemia. The Plantaris longus tendon is not clearly distinguishable, differential diagnosis includes rupture.

Assessment
Left Achilles Tendon:
•	Non-insertional Achilles tendinopathy (approximately 2.5 cm proximal to the insertion, thickened to about 11-12 mm). No rupture or partial rupture of the tendon.
•	Small posterior heel spur with an unremarkable and intact insertion.
