Findings: Status post right hip total endoprosthesis (TEP) implantation. No evidence of a loosening line, no pathological contrast enhancement around the prosthesis. Signal alteration in the lateral approach path, with marked contrast enhancement. Overall, abundant fibrotic tissue. Insertional tendinopathy of the anterior gluteus minimus muscle, with largely normal attachment of the gluteus medius.

Assessment:
-No indication of hip TEP loosening or periprosthetic infection (PPI).
-Gluteal tendon insufficiency of the anterior portion of the gluteus minimus.
-Fibrosis formation in the surgical approach path and around the prosthetic neck.
