MRI of the Entire Spine

Findings
Recent ventral endplate compressions (AO A1) from T2 to T12, with more central than ventral impressions observed in the lower thoracic spine. T7 also shows a slight central endplate impression. However, there is no reduction in the height of the posterior vertebral margins. The anterior and posterior longitudinal ligaments, as well as the ligamenta flava, are intact. There are at most very slight myogelosis of the proximal musculature in the thoracic spine region (differential diagnosis: contusion). No reduction in the height of the posterior vertebral margins. No myelopathy. No significant prevertebral soft tissue swelling. Median disc extrusion at L4/5 without nerve root involvement. Small median disc protrusion at L5/S1 also without nerve root involvement. Vertebral bodies in the lumbar spine appear unremarkable.

Impression
Multiple ventral endplate compressions from T2 to T12 (AO A1) with an additional endplate impression at T7. The posterior vertebral margins are preserved. Intact ligaments of the anterior, middle, and posterior columns. No intraspinal bleeding. No significant prevertebral hematoma. No myelopathy.
