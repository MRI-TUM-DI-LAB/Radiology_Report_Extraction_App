Clinical Information, Question, Justification: Crohn's disease, status post rectovaginal fistula and left gracilis flap. Follow-up imaging requested.

Technique: 1.5-Tesla MRI of the pelvis. Localizer. T1 TSE axial, T2 TIRM sagittal, T2 TSE axial and coronal. Post intravenous administration of 7 ml Gadovist, T1-TSE axial, coronal, and sagittal.

Findings: Currently, there is a suture present in the known defect of the anterior rectal wall approximately 2.5 cm from the anus, extending over the gracilis flap beneath the posterior vaginal wall (Series 9/36). There is regressing edema of the left gracilis flap. No evidence of a new fistulous tract. Minimal free fluid in the pelvis. The stoma in the right lower abdomen is included in the imaging. No pathologically distended bowel loops. No enlarged lymph nodes. The bony structures appear unremarkable.

Impression: The defect in the anterior rectal wall, with the fistulous tract directly beneath the posterior vaginal wall and the presence of a suture, continues to appear not fully granulated.
