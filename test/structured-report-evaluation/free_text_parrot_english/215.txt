Clinical Information, Question, Justification for Examination: Dyspnea since today. Renal cell carcinoma. Suspected right heart strain. Pulmonary embolism? Infiltrate? Effusion? Critically ill patient. No informed consent discussion was conducted.

Examination Technique: Digital overview radiographs. Multislice CT of the thorax in the pulmonary arterial contrast phase following intravenous administration of 50 ml Xenetix-350. Multiplanar reconstruction. Dose-length product: 170 mGy.cm.

Findings and Assessment: Previous CT scans available for comparison.
- No evidence of pulmonary artery embolism. No signs of right heart strain.
- Coronary sclerosis. Mitral valve sclerosis. No circumferential pericardial effusion. Aneurysm of the ascending aorta (5 cm), ectasia of other captured aortic segments, significant aortic elongation.
- Largely stable, at most slightly basally redistributed right pleural effusion with up to 6 cm dorsal rim wiRXh and adjacent lower lobe atelectasis. Small pleural effusion on the left as well. No pneumothorax.
- Thickened bronchial walls and peribronchial consolidations in the dorsobasal left lower lobe, differential diagnosis pneumonia. Emphysematous changes in lung structure.
- Oncological status in the thorax appears unchanged in the short term. Captured mass in the right renal fossa unchanged.
- Demers catheter via right jugular vein with tip in the superior vena cava.
