MRI ABDOMEN

Both adrenal glands appear slightly bulky, without any distinct oval mass. There is a slight, elongated oval enlargement of the lateral limb of the right adrenal gland with a transverse diameter of 7 mm, similar to the previous examination with minimal change in layering. Due to its small size, it measures 16 HU natively, 65 HU in the portal venous phase, and 44 HU in the delayed phase, with a 43% absolute washout (absolute washout < 60% and native density >10 HU is considered an unclear result), and a relative washout of 32% (relative washout < 40% is also not definitive).

The basal lungs show no pleural effusion or infiltrates. No pericardial effusion is present. The liver texture is homogeneous, with slightly reduced native density (48 HU), consistent with mild steatosis. A previously known small hypodense cystoid lesion in liver segment VI, most likely a cyst, is too small for sufficient density measurement. There is no dilation of the bile ducts. The gallbladder is unremarkable. There is significant regression of the previously described imbibition of the fat tissue adjacent to the uncinate process/pars horizontalis of the duodenum, currently with at most slight residual imbibition adjacent to the uncinate process. The pancreas shows no ductal dilation or focal lesions. The spleen has a homogeneous texture, with a craniocaudal pole distance of up to 12.5 cm, slightly enlarged.

The kidneys show symmetrical contrast enhancement, with slender renal pelvis and ureteral origins. A hypodense, cystoid lesion measuring 13 mm in the intermediate part of the left kidney, with 6 HU natively and no contrast enhancement dynamics, corresponds to a simple cyst. Smaller hypodense, cystoid lesions measuring up to 3 mm are present in the intermediate part of the right kidney and at the lower pole of both kidneys, too small for further differentiation. The bladder is barely filled, with a consequently accentuated wall contour. The prostate has a transverse diameter of 4.6 cm. The seminal vesicles are approximately symmetrical, possibly slightly more pronounced on the right, similar to the previous examination.

No ascites. No pneumoperitoneum. No suspiciously enlarged lymph nodes. There is a slightly inhomogeneous increased density of the mesenteric fat tissue with possibly slightly increased numbers of non-suspiciously enlarged lymph nodes in the left hemiabdomen, comparable to the previous examination, differential diagnosis possibly indicating "misty mesentery," ultimately not very specific.

The gastrointestinal tract shows no segmental significant distension or surrounding reaction. The appendix vermiformis is not clearly delineable, and there is no notable surrounding reaction pericecally. The stomach is slightly filled. The aorta shows homogeneous contrast enhancement in the given contrast phase. The portal vein and its tributaries show homogeneous contrast enhancement. Pre-existing fatty accentuated inguinal canals, slightly more pronounced on the left, appear unremarkable.

The alignment of the visualized vertebral bodies is intact. Moderate degenerative changes are present. No suspicious osseous lesion.

Assessment

No distinct, circumscribed mass in the slightly bulky adrenal glands on both sides. Possibly slightly pronounced, elongated oval enlargement of the lateral limb of the right adrenal gland, up to 7 mm in transverse diameter, similar to the previous examination. Differential diagnosis due to small size, density values, and washout dynamics cannot be clearly attributed to a lipid-rich adenoma. Differential diagnosis due to slight manifestation ultimately not definitive, possibly due to bulky configuration. Significant regression of peripancreatic fat tissue imbibition.
