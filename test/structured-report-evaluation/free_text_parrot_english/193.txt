Clinical Information, Question, Justification: Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) stage IV on the left. Please visualize the rest of the leg.

Method and Findings: Supine position. Skin disinfection and sterile draping. Local anesthesia and verification of its effectiveness. Ultrasound-guided retrograde arterial micro-puncture (inner lumen) of the left common femoral artery (patch). Angiographies. Persistent occlusion of the superficial femoral artery with reconstitution 12 cm distally via collaterals from the well-contrasted profunda femoris artery. Moderate to severe stenoses of the superficial femoral artery extending into the popliteal artery (in segments P1 and P2). Well-contrasted posterior tibial artery extending into the foot (primary arterial vessel in the lower leg). Mild stenosis of the anterior tibial artery. The fibular and anterior tibial arteries taper off in the distal lower leg at the level of the malleolus.

Assessment:
- Technically successful and complication-free angiographic visualization of the left leg.
- Persistent occlusion of the superficial femoral artery with reconstitution 12 cm distally via profunda femoris artery collaterals.
- Persistent, high-grade stenoses of the superficial femoral artery and popliteal artery (in segments P1 and P2). The P3 segment shows no significant stenoses.
- Well-contrasted posterior tibial artery (leading vessel in the lower leg). The fibular and anterior tibial arteries taper off at the level of the malleolus with subtotal stenoses (differential diagnosis: occlusions) at the same location.
