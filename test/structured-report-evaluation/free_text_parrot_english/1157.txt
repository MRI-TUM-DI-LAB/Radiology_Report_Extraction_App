No prior studies are available for comparison. The liver, gallbladder, spleen, and kidneys appear unremarkable on cursory examination. The pancreas is unremarkable as far as can be visualized. The appendix is thickened up to 1 cm with significant surrounding reaction, raising suspicion for an early abscess due to hypoechoic changes. Adjacent bowel loops also show wall thickening with surrounding reaction. No free fluid is present.
