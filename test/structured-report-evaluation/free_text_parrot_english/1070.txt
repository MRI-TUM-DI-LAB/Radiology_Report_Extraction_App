CT Cervical Spine

The cervical spine consists of seven vertebrae. The cervical lordosis is preserved, as is the alignment. The dens axis is centered. Facet joints are congruent. There is uncovertebral arthrosis at the C5/6 level following a previous disc replacement surgery at this level. No reduction in vertebral body height, no acute fracture. There is a focal, central disc herniation at the C4/5 level with narrowing of the anterior subarachnoid space. Cervical soft tissues are symmetrical.

Impression
• No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
• No fracture of the cervical spine.
• Incidental finding of a focal, central disc herniation at the C4/5 level with narrowing of the anterior subarachnoid space.
