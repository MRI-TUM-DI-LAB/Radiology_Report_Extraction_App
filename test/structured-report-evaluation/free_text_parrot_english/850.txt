Findings:  
There is a focal area of opacification in the right mid-lung field. The upper mediastinum is narrow, and the trachea is midline and clear. The heart is normally shaped and not enlarged. The hilar and pulmonary vascular markings are unremarkable. The soft tissue shadow is unremarkable.

Impression:  
The focal area of opacification in the right mid-lung field is consistent with a pneumonic infiltrate. Given the somewhat lobulated morphology, follow-up is recommended.
