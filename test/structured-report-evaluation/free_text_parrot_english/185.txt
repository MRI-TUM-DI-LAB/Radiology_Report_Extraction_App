Clinical Information, Question, Justification: Dialysis-dependent renal insufficiency. Request for implantation of a tunneled dialysis catheter. 

Method: Supine position. Ultrasound of the right neck. Skin disinfection and sterile draping. Local anesthesia with approximately 40 ml of Xylonest 1%. Ultrasound-guided puncture of the right internal jugular vein and insertion of a peel-away sheath. Tunneling of the dialysis catheter and introduction through the sheath. Removal of the sheath. Position check of the catheter under fluoroscopy. Flow check of both lumens. Locking of both lumens with 4% citrate solution (Citralock). Dressing applied. Fluoroscopy time: 0.6 min. Fluoro. 109.14 µGy/m².

Findings: Right jugular insertion of a tunneled dialysis catheter (GlidePath Long-Term, 23 cm length from hub to catheter tip).

Conclusion: Technically successful and complication-free placement of a tunneled hemodialysis catheter. Projection of the catheter tip in the right atrium.
