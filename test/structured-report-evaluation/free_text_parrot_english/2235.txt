Clinic, Question, Justifying Indication:
Polytrauma alert: Patient fell from a 3-meter height from a ladder. Retrograde amnesia. Question regarding traumatic injuries.
The justifying indication for the use of ionizing radiation was provided by the responsible, qualified physician.
Information and Consent:
Emergency indication. Monitoring of renal and thyroid function recommended.
Examination Technique:
Digital radiographs. Native acquisition of the neurocranium. Following intravenous administration of a total of 140 ml Xenetix 350 as a split-bolus, acquisition of the head, neck, chest, and abdomen was performed. Multiplanar reconstructions. Dose-length product: 1720.20 mGy*cm.
Findings and Assessment:
Conventional radiographs of the cervical spine from 11.12.2023 and lumbar spine from 11.10.2023 are available for comparison.
Neurocranium:
Small 5 mm hyperdensity in the left frontal lobe – suspicious for a small intracerebral hemorrhage.
No fresh or demarcating ischemia.
Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) aspect with an Evans index of 0.39 and bilateral widening of the Sylvian fissures.
No midline shift. No herniation.
Small subgaleal hematoma left frontal.
Viscerocranium/Neck:
Mild mucosal swelling in the right maxillary sinus; other paranasal sinuses, tympanic cavities, and mastoid cells are well-aerated.
6 mm hypodense, peripherally calcified lesion in the left thyroid lobe.
Vascular System:
Vertebral arteries are bilaterally patent; however, the right vertebral artery in the V4 segment is in close proximity to the mentioned fragment of the atlas.
No other injuries to the major vessels.
Moderate calcifications in the carotid bifurcations bilaterally.
High-grade stenosis at the origin of the right internal carotid artery.
Partial thrombosis of the infrarenal aorta.
Thorax:
No pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or hemothorax.
No evidence of lung contusion or laceration. No infiltrates.
Heart borderline in size. Coronary and aortic sclerosis.
Abdomen:
No free air or fluid.
No injury to the parenchymal organs.
Old cortical parenchymal defects of the right kidney.
Sigmoid diverticulosis.
Skeletal System:
Comminuted, displaced fracture of the atlas involving the right paramedian anterior arch as well as the right and left posterior arches.
Non-displaced odontoid fracture (Type II according to Anderson and D’Alonzo).
Suspected disco-ligamentous injury due to incongruence in the right atlantoaxial joint.
Advanced degenerative changes in the spine with multisegmental osteochondrosis intervertebralis.
Left hip total endoprosthesis (TEP).
Summary:
Suspected small intracerebral hemorrhage in the left frontal lobe.
Imaging consistent with an unstable cervical spine injury, with a comminuted fracture of the anterior and posterior arches of the atlas and a fracture of the odontoid process (Type II according to Anderson and D’Alonzo).
Suspected disco-ligamentous injury due to incongruence in the right atlantoaxial joint.
Note:
An immediate discussion of the findings with the responsible trauma surgery physician has taken place.
