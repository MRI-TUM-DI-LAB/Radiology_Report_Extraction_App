Ultrasound of the Shoulder

Pain reported (also inducible by sonopalpation) anteriorly over the hypertrophic-arthritic AC joint, currently no significant signs of activation, no effusion, no hyperemia (differential diagnosis: resolving condition). 
The glenohumeral joint shows no significant joint effusion and no capsular hyperemia.
Suspected trans-tendinous rupture of the supraspinatus tendon without significant retraction, additionally, a markedly thickened infraspinatus tendon with partial tears (likely chronic, with relatively good ability to perform the hand-behind-back maneuver and abduction). 
At least partially intact subscapularis tendon. 
Tendinopathic long head of the biceps tendon, not clearly visible in the intra-articular course (partial rupture possible). No significant hyperemia.
