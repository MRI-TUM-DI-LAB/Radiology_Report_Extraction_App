Clinic, Question, Justifying Indication:Patient with unclear epigastric pain, cramping, stabbing, and unrelated to food intake; esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and laboratory tests showed no conclusive findings. Pain correlation?
Findings: No relevant previous examinations are available for comparison.
Liver: Approximately 90% visible. Organ is of normal size (14 cm in the midclavicular line, MCL). Caudate lobe is borderline enlarged (6 x 2 cm). Sharp edge angles, smooth surface. Homogeneous, echonormal parenchyma. No focal lesions detectable in the visible area. Normal vascular pattern. Visible hepatic veins are patent. Portal vein is of normal wiRXh with antegrade flow (Vmax: 20 cm/s).
Gallbladder: Gallbladder is not enlarged, anechoic internal echo. Wall is of normal thickness with no signs of inflammation.
Bile Ducts: Intrahepatic bile ducts are not dilated. The extrahepatic common bile duct (CBD) in the visible area is of normal wiRXh (3 mm).
Pancreas: Normal size and unremarkable parenchyma as far as visible. The pancreatic duct in the visible area is not dilated.
Spleen: Spleen is of normal size (11 x 5 cm) and shape. Homogeneous parenchyma. Splenic vein is patent.
Kidneys and Urinary Tract: Kidneys are normal in size with an age-appropriate parenchyma/pelvis ratio. No dilation of the renal collecting system. 1.5 cm cortical renal cyst on the left side. No solid mass detectable. Urinary bladder is moderately filled and anechoic.
Gastrointestinal Tract: No evidence of thickened or dilated bowel loops in the visible area.
Retroperitoneum: No enlarged lymph nodes detectable as far as visible. Significant aortic sclerosis.
Free Fluids: No ascites, no pleural effusions.
Conclusion: Significant aortic sclerosis. Consider further diagnostics with CT angiography to rule out significant abdominal arterial vessel stenoses as the cause of the symptoms.
