CT Lumbar Spine without Contrast

There is a marginal fresh fracture of the endplate of T12 on the left side. Alignment is normal. A partially captured, known bilobed aneurysm of the abdominal aorta appears to be increasing in size; a consultation with an angiologist is recommended if necessary. There is a perirenal fluid rim and a small fluid collection adjacent to the paracolic area as well as in the pelvis.
