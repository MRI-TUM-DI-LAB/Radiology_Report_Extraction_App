Findings:  
Reduced inspiratory depth. The left costophrenic angle is obscured. There is a faint opacity in the left lower lung field projecting dorsally in the lateral view, most likely associated with the lower lobe. Hypertensive configuration of the heart and aorta. The upper mediastinum is not widened, and the trachea is not stenosed. Moderate degenerative changes in the spine. Clip material projected over the right upper abdomen, consistent with post-cholecystectomy status.

Impression:  
Faint opacity likely in the left lower lung lobe, consistent with a pneumonic infiltrate. Left-sided costophrenic angle effusion, possibly parapneumonic.
