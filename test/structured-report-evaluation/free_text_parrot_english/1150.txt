Clinical Question: Evaluation of chronic abdominal pain  
Technique: MRI of the abdomen with contrast.  
Findings: The liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, and kidneys appear normal. There is a segment of the small intestine with wall thickening and contrast enhancement, consistent with inflammation, most likely in the terminal ileum. No evidence of strictures or fistulas.  
Impression: Inflammatory changes in the small intestine, further evaluation recommended.
