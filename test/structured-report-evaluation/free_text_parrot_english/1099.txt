CT Angiography from Aorta to Peripheral

Abdominal Vessels: No significant stenosis of the singularly arranged renal arteries, celiac trunk, SMA, or IMA. Following Y-graft placement, the proximal and distal anastomoses to the left common femoral artery (CFA) and right superficial femoral artery (SFA) are unremarkable. No extravasation. The aorta remains well-opacified without significant stenosis.

Left Axis: The internal iliac artery (IIA) shows multiple stenoses up to 75%. There is a 50-75% stenosis at the origin of the external iliac artery (EIA), which is occluded from its origin. The CFA is supplied by the bypass and measures 1.6 cm in diameter near the bifurcation following patch angioplasty. The profunda femoris artery (PFA) is well-opacified. The SFA is narrow with multiple caliber variations and stenoses up to 50%. No significant stenosis of the popliteal artery (PA). Shortly after its origin, the anterior tibial artery (ATA) shows coarse calcification and is only questionably opacified distally. Coarse calcification is also present in the tibioperoneal trunk with high-grade stenosis. As far as can be assessed with venous contrast, the posterior tibial artery (PTA) and peroneal artery (PA) are opacified well into the periphery.

Right Axis: In the bypassed and still perfused pelvic axis, there is no significant stenosis of the IIA. There is a 25-50% stenosis at the origin of the EIA, with a filiform stenosis mainly in the distal segment. At least 50% stenosis of the CFA. Approximately 50% stenosis near the origin of the PFA. The proximal SFA is also about 75% stenosed up to the anastomosis with the bypass. No significant SFA stenosis distal to the anastomosis. The PA is continuously opacified. As far as can be assessed with venous contrast, the lower leg vessels are faintly but peripherally opacified, with some showing coarse calcifications.

Under Extremities and Abdomen: No bone lesions suspicious for malignancy. Unremarkable depiction of the basal, partially captured lung sections. Unchanged, unremarkable depiction of the parenchymal abdominal organs with a small accessory spleen. Currently, a slightly less pronounced hiatal hernia with otherwise unremarkable depiction of the gastrointestinal structures, with a few non-irritated sigmoid diverticula. No lymph nodes suspicious for malignancy in the abdomen.

Assessment: The Y-graft is continuously opacified without evidence of extravasation or anastomotic aneurysm. Currently, the left SFA is slightly better opacified. Formal cross-sectional occlusion of the left lower leg due to high-grade stenosis of the anterior tibial artery and tibioperoneal trunk. Unchanged three-vessel runoff on the right.
