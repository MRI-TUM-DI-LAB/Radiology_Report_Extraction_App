Clinical Information, Question, Justification for Examination: Status post subileus. Status post ileus surgery in 2004. Suspected ileus/subileus. 

Consent and Explanation: After taking a risk history, verbal and written explanation was provided regarding the contrast application and examination procedure, as well as potential risks of the examination (see also consent form). Written consent from the patient was obtained.

Technique: Digital overview radiographs. Multislice CT of the abdomen in axial sections and venous contrast phase. Uncomplicated administration of 120 ml Xenetix-350. Multiplanar reconstruction. Dose-length product: 1156.8 mGy.cm.

Findings and Assessment: CT abdomen from 04/03/23 for comparison.

- Liver is not enlarged and has smooth margins with a homogeneous internal structure. No intra- or extrahepatic cholestasis. Gallbladder appears normal. Homogeneous portal vein contrast. Common bile duct not dilated.
- Spleen is borderline enlarged (pole-to-pole distance 12 cm) with homogeneous margins and no evidence of focal lesions. Pancreas is lobulated as typical for the organ. No dilation of the pancreatic duct. No evidence of focal lesions. Adrenal glands are unremarkable.
- Kidneys are normal in size and show symmetrical contrast enhancement. No dilation of the urinary tract. Bladder is only slightly filled. No wall thickening.
- Slightly distended ileal loops in the mid-abdomen (e.g., series 3, image 421). Surgical clips in the mid-abdomen as well. Status post appendectomy. Suture material in the sigmoid colon appears non-irritating (series 4, image 451). No free air and no free fluid.
- No evidence of pathologically enlarged or configured mesenteric, retroperitoneal, or iliac lymph nodes.
- Fat-filled umbilical hernia.
- Unremarkable appearance of the included lower lung sections.
- No evidence of osteodestruction suggestive of inflammation.

Summary Assessment: Slightly distended small bowel loops in the mid-abdomen without evidence of an obstruction or mechanical passage hindrance. No free air, small amounts of free fluid in the lower abdomen. No evidence of a convincing abdominal infection focus.
