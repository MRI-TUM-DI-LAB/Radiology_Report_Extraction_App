CT of the Neurocranium

Mild cerebral volume reduction. Approximately stable appearance of the left basal ganglia hemorrhage with distinctly hyperdense blood components, measuring 4.1 x 1.5 cm, with almost unchanged, slightly inhomogeneous density of about 70 - 80 HU. Mass effect with compression of the left lateral ventricle and the third ventricle, as well as a midline shift to the right of approximately 5 mm, roughly unchanged from the previous examination. Shunt from the right frontal area with the tip position unchanged, approximately at the foramen of Monro. Mild, perifocal, hypodense demarcation in the trajectory. No signs of upward or downward herniation. No enlargement of the temporal horns over time. Basal cisterns and foramen magnum are clear. No early signs of ischemia. No hyperdense artery sign. No subacute infarct demarcation. No new parenchymal defects. No lacunar defects. No white matter hypodensities indicative of microangiopathy. No fracture of the skull base, calvarium, or midface. Paranasal sinuses and mastoid cells are well-aerated. Orbits are unremarkable.

Impression:
Approximately stable appearance of the acute left basal ganglia hemorrhage with unchanged mass effect, with continued midline shift of about 5 mm. No upward or downward herniation, no hydrocephalus over time.
