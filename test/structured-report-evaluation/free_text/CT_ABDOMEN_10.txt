CT
 ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH CONTRASTCLINICAL HISTORY: Abdominal distention 
and constipationTECHNIQUE: Multiple axial and coronal CT images were 
obtained through the abdomen and pelvis after administration of 
intravenous contrast material. FINDINGS: There is diffuse wall 
thickening of the sigmoid colon with pericolic fat stranding, consistent
 with sigmoid diverticulitis. No abscess, perforation, or extraluminal 
air is seen. The remaining colon is unremarkable without evidence of 
obstruction. The liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, and adrenal 
glands are unremarkable. The intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ducts
 are not dilated. The kidneys demonstrate no hydronephrosis, and the 
ureters are unremarkable. The small bowel loops are normal, without 
obstruction, wall thickening, or dilatation. The uterus is normal in 
size and contour, and both ovaries are normal in appearance without any 
adnexal masses or free fluid. The urinary bladder is partially 
distended, but otherwise unremarkable.IMPRESSION: Diffuse sigmoid 
diverticulitis with pericolic fat stranding, without evidence of abscess
 or perforation.
