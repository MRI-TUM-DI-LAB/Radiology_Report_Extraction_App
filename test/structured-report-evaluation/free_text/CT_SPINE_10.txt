 LUMBAR SPINE WITHOUT CONTRASTCLINICAL HISTORY: A 38-year-old female 
with lower back pain and history of scoliosis. COMPARISON: No comparison
 studies available.TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial CT images were obtained 
through the lumbar spine. Coronal and sagittal reformats were produced. 
The estimated radiation exposure is __ mGy per slice and __ mGy*cm 
cumulative dose. FINDINGS: The lumbar spine alignment demonstrates a 
mild leftward convex scoliosis. Vertebral body heights are preserved. 
The intervertebral disc spaces are maintained, with no significant disc 
abnormalities. There is mild multilevel degenerative disc disease and 
facet joint hypertrophy, most pronounced at L4-L5, without significant 
spinal canal or foraminal stenosis. The remaining lumbar discs and facet
 joints show no significant abnormalities. The prevertebral and 
paravertebral soft tissues appear normal. The visualized portions of the
 abdomen and pelvis are unremarkable. IMPRESSION: Mild leftward convex 
scoliosis of the lumbar spine. Mild multilevel degenerative disc disease
 and facet joint hypertrophy, most pronounced at L4-L5, without 
significant spinal canal or foraminal stenosis. No evidence of acute 
fracture, subluxation, or significant spinal stenosis.
