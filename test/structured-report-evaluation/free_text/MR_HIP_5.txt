CLINICAL
 HISTORY: A 38-year-old female patient experiencing atypical hip pain, 
worsening when crossing legs. COMPARISON: None available. PROCEDURE: 
Coronal T1, SPIR, sagittal proton density, and axial T1-weighted images 
are obtained.FINDINGS: The study is of adequate quality with contrast 
seen throughout the joint space. There is a mild anterosuperior 
acetabular overcoverage consistent with a pincer morphology. The labrum 
is hypertrophic and irregular, with a small tear identified in the 
anterior-superior quadrant. The ligamentum teres appears thickened and 
mildly edematous. There is a moderate joint effusion. A small paralabral
 cyst is noted adjacent to the labral tear. No significant cartilage 
loss is identified. The femoral head is spherical without evidence of 
flattening or any focal bony signal abnormalities. The acetabulum 
appears to be somewhat shallow and retroverted.IMPRESSION: Mild 
pincer-type femoroacetabular impingement with anterosuperior acetabular 
overcoverage. Anterior-superior labral tear with an adjacent small 
paralabral cyst. Hypertrophic labrum and thickened, edematous ligamentum
 teres, likely secondary to the pincer morphology and acetabular 
retroversion. Moderate joint effusion. Somewhat shallow and retroverted 
acetabulum.
