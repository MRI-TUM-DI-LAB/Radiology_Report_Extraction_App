 CERVICAL SPINE WITHOUT CONTRASTCLINICAL HISTORY: A 52-year-old male 
with neck pain and history of cervical spine surgery. COMPARISON: No 
comparison studies available. TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial CT images were
 obtained through the cervical spine. Coronal and sagittal reformats 
were produced. The estimated radiation exposure is __ mGy per slice and 
__ mGy*cm cumulative dose. FINDINGS: The cervical spine alignment is 
maintained. There is evidence of prior C4-C5 and C5-C6 anterior cervical
 discectomy and fusion with stable anterior hardware. Vertebral body 
heights are preserved. The intervertebral disc spaces are well 
maintained. No significant spinal canal or foraminal stenosis is seen at
 the fused levels. At C3-C4, there is mild disc bulging and mild 
bilateral facet joint hypertrophy, resulting in mild central canal 
stenosis and mild bilateral foraminal stenosis. The remaining cervical 
discs and facet joints show no significant abnormalities. The 
prevertebral and paravertebral soft tissues appear normal. The 
visualized portions of the lung apices and mediastinum are unremarkable.
 IMPRESSION: Post-surgical changes at C4-C5 and C5-C6 with stable 
hardware and no evidence of complications. Mild disc bulging and facet 
joint hypertrophy at C3-C4 with mild central canal stenosis and mild 
bilateral foraminal stenosis. No evidence of acute fracture, 
subluxation, or significant spinal stenosis.
