CLINICAL
 HISTORY: A 62-year-old female presenting with persistent abdominal pain
 and bloating. The patient has a history of hypertension and type 2 
diabetes mellitus. Screening for potential malignancy is requested. 
COMPARISON: None. PROCEDURE: A multiplanar, multisequence MRI of the 
abdomen and pelvis was performed on a 3 Tesla magnet. Gadolinium-based 
intravenous contrast was administered during the exam. FINDINGS: The 
lung bases are visualized with no obvious abnormalities. The liver is 
unremarkable in size and contour, and there is no evidence of focal 
lesions or masses. The intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts appear 
unremarkable, with no dilatation. The gallbladder appears normal with no
 cholelithiasis, wall thickening, or pericholecystic fluid. The pancreas
 shows a 2.1 cm hypoenhancing mass in the head, raising the suspicion 
for a neoplastic process. No pancreatic duct dilatation is observed. The
 adrenal glands, spleen, and kidneys appear normal, with no masses or 
other abnormalities identified. The stomach and bowel loops are 
unremarkable, with no evidence of obstruction, wall thickening, or focal
 lesions. The mesenteric vasculature appears patent, and there are no 
signs of significant lymphadenopathy. In the pelvis, the urinary bladder
 is unremarkable, and there are no pelvic masses or lymphadenopathy. The
 visualized portions of the pelvic bones and musculature appear normal. 
IMPRESSION: A 2.1 cm hypoenhancing mass in the head of the pancreas, 
suspicious for a neoplastic process. Further evaluation with an 
endoscopic ultrasound and fine-needle aspiration is recommended for 
definitive diagnosis. No other significant abnormalities detected within
 the abdomen or pelvis.
