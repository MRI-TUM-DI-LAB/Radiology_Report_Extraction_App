CT
 ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH CONTRASTCLINICAL HISTORY: Hematuria and a 
history of smokingTECHNIQUE: Multiple axial and coronal CT images were 
obtained through the abdomen and pelvis after administration of 
intravenous contrast material. FINDINGS: 3.1 cm enhancing mass in the 
upper pole of the right kidney, which is suspicious for renal cell 
carcinoma. The mass demonstrates heterogeneous enhancement with areas of
 central necrosis. No hydronephrosis or perinephric fat stranding is 
identified. The liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, and adrenal glands
 demonstrate no focal abnormalities. The intrahepatic and extrahepatic 
biliary ducts are not dilated. No enlarged lymph nodes or masses are 
seen in the mesentery or retroperitoneum. The left kidney demonstrates 
no hydronephrosis, and the ureters are unremarkable. The small and large
 bowel loops are normal without obstruction, wall thickening, or 
dilatation. No free air or fluid is identified in the peritoneal cavity.
 The urinary bladder demonstrates a focal area of wall thickening in the
 right posterolateral wall measuring 1.2 cm. The region demonstrates 
focal circumferential thickening with areas of mild enhancement. This 
finding is suspicious for a bladder neoplasm, such as urothelial 
carcinoma, and further evaluation is warranted. The prostate gland is 
unremarkable in size and contour.IMPRESSION: Right renal mass, 
suspicious for renal cell carcinoma. Focal bladder wall thickening, 
suspicious for bladder neoplasm.
