MRI
 BRAIN: __ COMPARISON: __ CLINICAL HISTORY: 48-year-old female with a 
history of ischemic stroke and persistent headaches. Follow up 
evaluation. TECHNIQUE: Brain protocol including DWI and T2*-weighted 
sequences. FINDINGS: There is an area of encephalomalacia in the left 
middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory, consistent with the patient's 
history of ischemic stroke. No acute infarct or hemorrhage is identified
 on the T2*-weighted gradient-recalled echo (GRE) images. The ventricles
 and sulci are within normal limits for age. There is no mass, 
mass-effect, or midline shift. No abnormal enhancement is observed 
following the administration of gadolinium. Periventricular and deep 
white matter T2/FLAIR hyperintensities are seen, likely representing 
chronic small vessel ischemic changes. No significant interval change is
 noted compared to the previous examination. The major intracranial 
vessels show normal flow voids. The visualized paranasal sinuses and 
mastoid air cells are clear. The orbits appear unremarkable. IMPRESSION:
 Chronic encephalomalacia in the left MCA territory, consistent with the
 patient's history of ischemic stroke. No acute infarct or hemorrhage 
identified. Chronic small vessel ischemic changes in the periventricular
 and deep white matter. No significant interval change compared to the 
prior examination.
