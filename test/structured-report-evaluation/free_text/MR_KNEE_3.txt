EXAM:
 MRI KNEE RIGHT WITHOUT CONTRAST EXAM DATE: __ HISTORY: The patient 
presents with right knee pain. TECHNIQUE: The MRI examination of the 
right knee was conducted using axial proton-density fat saturation, 
coronal proton density fat saturation, sagittal proton density, sagittal
 T2 inversion recovery, and coronal thin cut 1 mm T2 through the 
anterior cruciate ligament. FINDINGS: A moderate right knee joint 
effusion is observed. The patellar cartilage appears to be intact 
without any signs of degeneration. A moderate prepatellar bursitis is 
identified, with fluid accumulation in the prepatellar bursa region. The
 lateral collateral ligament complex appears intact. The lateral 
meniscus demonstrates a complex tear involving the anterior horn and 
body, while the medial meniscus appears unremarkable without any 
evidence of tearing. The medial joint compartment shows mild 
degenerative changes with slight thinning of the articular cartilage. 
The medial collateral ligament appears intact without any signs of 
sprain. The anterior cruciate ligament shows mild thickening, suggesting
 a grade I sprain, while the posterior cruciate ligament remains intact.
 Bone marrow signal reveals no signs of fractures. A moderate knee joint
 effusion is present. The quadriceps and patellar tendons appear intact 
and unremarkable. IMPRESSION: Moderate right knee joint effusion. 
Moderate prepatellar bursitis with fluid accumulation in the prepatellar
 bursa region. Complex tear involving the anterior horn and body of the 
lateral meniscus. Mild degenerative changes in the medial joint 
compartment with slight thinning of the articular cartilage. Grade I 
sprain of the anterior cruciate ligament with mild thickening. Intact 
quadriceps and patellar tendons.
