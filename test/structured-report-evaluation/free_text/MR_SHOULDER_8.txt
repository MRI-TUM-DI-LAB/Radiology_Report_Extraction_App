MRI
 SHOULDER:__. CLINICAL HISTORY: 62-year-old patient with left shoulder 
pain. COMPARISON: None available. PROCEDURE: On a 3T magnet, the 
following MR sequences were obtained of the left shoulder: three-plane 
localizer, coronal T1, coronal T2 with fat saturation, sagittal T1, 
sagittal PD with fat saturation, axial GRE, and axial PD with fat 
saturation through the labrum. FINDINGS: Mild degenerative changes of 
the acromioclavicular joint without significant osteophyte formation. 
Minimal subacromial subdeltoid bursal fluid. No significant glenohumeral
 joint effusion. Mild tendinopathy of the supraspinatus tendon without 
evidence of a tear. Infraspinatus, subscapularis, and teres minor 
tendons are intact and unremarkable. The long head of the biceps tendon 
appears intact and unremarkable. The biceps anchor is also unremarkable.
 No evidence of labral tear or detachment. The labrum appears intact. 
Mild chondral thinning at the glenohumeral joint, consistent with early 
osteoarthritis. No bone marrow edema or signal abnormalities noted. No 
pathologically enlarged lymph nodes or muscle atrophy. IMPRESSION: Mild 
degenerative changes of the glenohumeral joint with early 
osteoarthritis. Mild tendinopathy of the supraspinatus tendon without 
tear. Intact infraspinatus, subscapularis, and teres minor tendons. 
Intact long head of the biceps tendon and biceps anchor.
