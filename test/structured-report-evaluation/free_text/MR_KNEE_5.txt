HISTORY:
 Sudden basketball injury, concerns for PCL tear and potential chondral 
damage to the medial femoral condyle, and medial meniscus injury. 
COMPARISON: Not available. TECHNIQUE: Employing a 3T magnet, the 
subsequent MR sequences were acquired for the right knee: three-plane 
localizer, axial T2-weighted with fat saturation, coronal T1-weighted, 
coronal T2-weighted with fat saturation, sagittal proton-density, 
sagittal T1-weighted, and coronal 3D proton-density with fat saturation.
 FINDINGS: A minimal joint effusion was observed. Examination of the 
menisci revealed a radial tear in the posterior horn of the medial 
meniscus, while the lateral meniscus appeared intact. The anterior 
cruciate ligament and medial collateral ligament were unremarkable, but a
 complete rupture of the posterior cruciate ligament was noted. The 
iliotibial band and fibular collateral ligament remained intact. The 
extensor mechanism was found to be preserved, and no abnormal signal was
 seen within Hoffa's fat pad. Moderate bone marrow edema was present in 
the medial femoral condyle and medial tibial plateau, suggesting a 
contusion. Chondral damage was observed on the medial femoral condyle, 
and the bone marrow signal intensity appeared within normal limits. No 
Baker's cyst or pes anserine bursitis was detected. A mild myotendinous 
strain was noted in the vastus medialis muscle. IMPRESSION: MRI findings
 indicate a rupture of the posterior cruciate ligament, a bone contusion
 in the medial femoral condyle and medial tibial plateau, a radial tear 
in the posterior horn of the medial meniscus, chondral damage on the 
medial femoral condyle, and a mild myotendinous strain in the vastus 
medialis.
