 abnormalities. A moderate-sized, reducible umbilical hernia is noted.  
Both kidneys are within normal limits in terms of size and 
configuration. No renal or ureteral stones are present, and there is no 
hydroureter or hydronephrosis.  The appendix is not visualized, and 
there is no periappendiceal fat stranding. Diverticulosis is observed in
 the sigmoid colon, but no signs of acute diverticulitis are present. No
 bowel obstruction or significant bowel wall thickening is detected.  No
 abdominal ascites or lymphadenopathy is identified in the peritoneal

 masses. The prostate gland is grossly unremarkable, and no pelvic 
ascites or lymphadenopathy is observed.  Images of the lung bases reveal
 no pleural or parenchymal masses or pleural effusions. There are mild 
degenerative changes in the lumbar spine but no acute findings.
