CT
 ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH CONTRASTCLINICAL HISTORY: Acute onset of right 
lower quadrant painTECHNIQUE: Multiple axial and coronal CT images were 
obtained through the abdomen and pelvis after administration of 
intravenous contrast material. FINDINGS: The appendix is enlarged, 
measuring 1.2 cm in diameter with surrounding fat stranding and a small 
amount of free fluid in the right lower quadrant. These findings are 
consistent with acute appendicitis. The liver, gallbladder, pancreas, 
spleen, and adrenal glands are unremarkable. The intrahepatic and 
extrahepatic biliary ducts are not dilated. The kidneys demonstrate no 
hydronephrosis, and the ureters are unremarkable. The small and large 
bowel loops are normal, without obstruction, wall thickening, or 
dilatation. The uterus is normal in size and contour, and both ovaries 
are normal in appearance without any adnexal masses or free fluid. The 
urinary bladder is normal in contour. IMPRESSION: Acute appendicitis 
with surrounding fat stranding and a small amount of free fluid in the 
right lower quadrant.
