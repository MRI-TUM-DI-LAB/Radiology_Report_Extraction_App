CT
 CERVICAL SPINE WITHOUT CONTRASTCLINICAL HISTORY: A 54-year-old male 
with a history of neck pain and recent trauma. COMPARISON: No comparison
 studies available. TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial CT images were obtained 
through the cervical spine. Coronal and sagittal reformats were created.
 The estimated radiation exposure is __ mGy per slice and __ mGy*cm 
cumulative dose. FINDINGS: Alignment of the cervical spine is 
maintained. There is no evidence of acute fracture or subluxation. 
Vertebral body heights are preserved. The intervertebral disc spaces are
 well maintained. There is mild degenerative disc disease at C5-C6 with 
small osteophyte formation, most prominent on the left side, without 
significant foraminal narrowing. The remaining cervical discs show no 
significant abnormalities. The facet joints are unremarkable. The 
prevertebral and paravertebral soft tissues appear normal. No 
significant lymphadenopathy or masses are identified. The visualized 
portions of the posterior fossa and suprasellar region are unremarkable.
 IMPRESSION: Mild degenerative changes at C5-C6, without significant 
foraminal narrowing. No evidence of acute fracture, subluxation, or 
significant spinal stenosis.
