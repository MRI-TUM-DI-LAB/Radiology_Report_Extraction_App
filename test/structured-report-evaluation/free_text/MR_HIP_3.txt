MRI
 HIP: __.CLINICAL HISTORY: 41 years of age, female, severe atraumatic 
pain R hip, radiating down R leg, also in buttock; lupus, chronic 
steroids. COMPARISON: CT hip __, radiograph hip __. PROCEDURE: 
Multiplanar, multisequence imaging of the right hip and pelvis was 
performed at 3T without contrast. Full field of view imaging of the 
pelvis was also obtained.FINDINGS: Comparison is made with a CT scan and
 radiograph of the hip from __. There is no significant joint effusion 
within the hip. The right sacroiliac joint demonstrates irregularity, 
but there is no acute edema or fracture. The articular cartilage appears
 well-preserved, and bone marrow signal intensity is normal. No 
avascular necrosis is identified, and the femoral head-neck contour 
appears normal. A tear of the right anterosuperior labrum is noted, 
accompanied by a 5 mm paralabral cyst. The iliopsoas tendon appears 
intact, with trace bursal fluid. Mild tearing of the gluteus minimus and
 medius tendons at the greater trochanteric insertion is observed, along
 with adjacent peritendinous edema. No significant greater trochanteric 
bursitis is present. The gluteal, hamstring, and adductor tendons appear
 intact. A mild narrowing of the ischiofemoral interval is observed, 
with edema in the quadratus femoris muscle. A renal allograft is seen in
 the right hemipelvis. The sciatic nerve appears unremarkable. 
IMPRESSION: Low-grade partial tearing of the gluteus minimus and medius 
tendons at the right greater trochanter. This is not an acute 
abnormality. Right anterosuperior labral tear, with a small paralabral 
cyst. Narrowing of the right ischiofemoral interval with edema and 
quadratus femoris, can be seen in setting of ischiofemoral impingement.
