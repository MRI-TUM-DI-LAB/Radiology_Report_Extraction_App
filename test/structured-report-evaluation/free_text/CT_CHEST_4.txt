EXAM:
 CHEST CT SCAN WITH CONTRAST EXAM DATE: __.HISTORY: 52-year-old female 
with shortness of breath and cough. COMPARISON: Chest x-ray performed 
__. TECHNIQUE: Volumetric scanning was performed of the chest using 3 mm
 of collimation at 3 mm intervals after administering 100 mL of nonionic
 Ultravist 370 contrast. DLP = 740.50 mGy*cm. FINDINGS: The lung fields 
show scattered areas of ground-glass opacities in the bilateral upper 
lobes, more pronounced on the right side. No evidence of pulmonary 
nodules, masses, or pneumothorax. The tracheobronchial tree is patent 
and unremarkable. No significant mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy is
 identified. The heart, pericardium, great vessels, and mediastinum are 
within normal limits. A small right pleural effusion is present. No left
 pleural effusion is detected. The diaphragm appears intact. The liver 
shows normal attenuation, and no focal lesions are identified. The 
spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands appear unremarkable. The kidneys 
are normal in size and attenuation, with no evidence of hydronephrosis 
or calculi. No free fluid is present in the abdomen. Mild degenerative 
changes are observed in the thoracic spine. The visualized osseous 
structures and soft tissues appear within normal limits. IMPRESSION: 
Scattered ground-glass opacities in the bilateral upper lobes, more 
pronounced on the right side. These findings may represent an infectious
 or inflammatory process, such as atypical pneumonia. Clinical 
correlation and appropriate treatment are advised. Small right pleural 
effusion. No significant mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. Normal 
appearance of the visualized upper abdominal structures. Mild 
degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
