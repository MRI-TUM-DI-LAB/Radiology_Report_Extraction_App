EXAM:
 MRI NECK WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST EXAM DATE: __ HISTORY: Suspected 
mass in the left parapharyngeal space on prior CT exam. Evaluate for 
possible neoplastic involvement. Technique: The MRI of the neck includes
 the following sequences: Coronal T1, coronal T2 inversion recovery, 
axial T2 fat saturation, sagittal T2 inversion recovery, axial T1, 
sagittal T1, axial T1 fat saturation, and coronal, sagittal, and axial 
T1 post gadolinium with fat saturation. A total of 18 mL of Dotarem is 
administered as intravenous contrast. COMPARISON: CT neck __FINDINGS: A 
2.1 cm x 1.6 cm enhancing mass is observed in the left parapharyngeal 
space. The mass is causing mass effect on the adjacent structures, 
including the left-sided pharyngeal constrictor muscles and the left 
lateral aspect of the oropharynx. No invasion of surrounding structures 
is identified. The remaining neck structures, including the thyroid, 
parotid, and submandibular glands, are unremarkable in appearance. No 
significant lymphadenopathy is noted. The cervical spine appears normal,
 without evidence of metastatic disease. IMPRESSION: A 2.1 cm x 1.6 cm 
enhancing mass in the left parapharyngeal space, concerning for 
neoplastic involvement. Biopsy or surgical evaluation is recommended for
 further characterization and management. No evidence of cervical 
lymphadenopathy or metastatic disease to the cervical spine. Normal 
appearance of the thyroid, parotid, and submandibular glands.
