MRI
 Knee: __HISTORY: A 37-year-old male presents with left knee locking and
 discomfort. PROCEDURE: An MRI of the left knee was performed using a 3T
 magnet with various sequences. FINDINGS: Mild left knee joint effusion.
 The medial meniscus is intact, while the lateral meniscus demonstrates a
 complex tear involving the body and posterior horn. A displaced 
fragment is noted in the intercondylar notch. Both anterior and 
posterior cruciate ligaments are intact and normal in appearance. The 
medial and lateral collateral ligaments appear intact. The popliteus 
tendon and posterolateral corner structures are also intact. The 
quadriceps and patellar tendons are unremarkable, with no evidence of 
tendinopathy or tear. Hoffa's fat pad signal intensity is within normal 
limits. The articular cartilage of the medial and lateral compartments 
appears preserved. There is mild patellofemoral compartment cartilage 
signal heterogeneity, but no full-thickness chondral defect is 
identified. Bone marrow signal intensity is within normal limits. No 
Baker's cyst or pes anserine bursitis is identified. The visualized 
neurovascular structures appear unremarkable. IMPRESSION: Complex tear 
of the lateral meniscus involving the body and posterior horn with a 
displaced fragment in the intercondylar notch. Mild left knee joint 
effusion. Intact ligaments and tendons.
