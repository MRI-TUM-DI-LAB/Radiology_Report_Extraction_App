COMPARISON:
 __ CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 35-year-old patient with a history of 
severe headaches and visual disturbances. The patient is being evaluated
 for possible brain pathology. TECHNIQUE: Three-plane localizer, axial 
T1-weighted, axial T2-weighted, axial T2-weighted FLAIR, axial 
diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and coronal T2-weighted images. 
Intravenous contrast was administered, and post-contrast axial and 
coronal T1-weighted images were acquired. FINDINGS: No mass, hemorrhage,
 or acute infarct is identified. There is no midline shift or 
hydrocephalus. The ventricular system and sulci are within normal 
limits. There is a small area of T2 hyperintensity and post-contrast 
enhancement in the left occipital lobe, measuring approximately 0.8 x 
0.7 cm. This lesion is associated with minimal surrounding edema. The 
imaging findings are suggestive of a demyelinating lesion or possibly a 
small meningioma. No other abnormal parenchymal signal or enhancement is
 seen. The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. The orbits
 appear unremarkable. The major intracranial vessels demonstrate normal 
flow voids. IMPRESSION: A small enhancing lesion in the left occipital 
lobe, possibly representing a demyelinating lesion or a small 
meningioma. Further evaluation with follow-up imaging or neurological 
consultation may be warranted. No evidence of acute intracranial 
abnormality or other significant findings. Clear paranasal sinuses and 
mastoid air cells.
