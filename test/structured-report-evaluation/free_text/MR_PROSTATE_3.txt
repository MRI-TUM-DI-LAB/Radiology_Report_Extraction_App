MRI
 ABDOMEN AND PELVIS FOR EVALUATION OF THE PROSTATECOMPARISON: ()CLINICAL
 HISTORY: The patient is a 72-year-old male with elevated PSA levels and
 a history of prostate cancer. A multiparametric prostate MRI was 
performed to assess the possibility of extraprostatic extension. 
TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar, multisequence MRI of the abdomen and pelvis was 
performed, including diffusion, T2, and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) 
imaging of the prostate. The post-contrast images were obtained 
following the uneventful intravenous administration of 8 mL of 
gadobutrol (Gadavist) gadolinium-containing contrast. FINDINGS: The 
prostate gland measures 4.1 x 4.3 x 4.6 cm (volume 42 mL). There is a 
focal area of T2 hypointensity in the left mid-gland measuring 
approximately 11 x 9 mm in diameter. The area shows restricted diffusion
 on the ADC map, with a value of 890 x 10^-3 mm^2/s. The dynamic 
contrast-enhanced (DCE) characteristics show focal enhancing lesion with
 washout kinetics in the left mid-gland, with a PI-RADS v2 score of 5. 
The area shows capsular abutment and is likely associated with 
extraprostatic extension. No other suspicious lesions or abnormal signal
 intensity are seen in the peripheral zone of the prostate gland. 
IMPRESSION: Based on the above findings, a focal area of T2 
hypointensity with restricted diffusion and washout kinetics on DCE 
suggests the presence of clinically significant cancer in the left 
mid-gland with a PI-RADS v2 score of 5. The capsular abutment and likely
 extraprostatic extension of the lesion is concerning for prostate 
cancer invasion into surrounding tissues. This finding requires further 
evaluation and monitoring for possible treatment options.
