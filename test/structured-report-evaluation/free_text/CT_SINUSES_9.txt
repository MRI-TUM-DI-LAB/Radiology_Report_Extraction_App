 SINUSESCLINICAL HISTORY: A 35-year-old female patient with persistent 
sinus pressure, post-nasal drip, and anosmia. COMPARISON: None available
 at the time of dictation. TECHNIQUE: A CT scan of the sinuses was 
performed following the administration of 60 mL of iopamidol __% 
injection IV contrast. The estimated radiation dose (CTDIvol [mGy]) for 
each series in this exam is __, and the estimated cumulative dose (DLP 
[mGy-cm]) is __.FINDINGS: The frontal sinuses exhibit mild mucosal 
thickening. The ethmoid sinuses demonstrate moderate mucosal thickening 
and partial opacification. The maxillary sinuses show moderate mucosal 
thickening, and the ostiomeatal complexes are patent bilaterally. The 
sphenoid sinuses reveal mild mucosal thickening. The nasal cavity 
displays a small nasal polyp arising from the right middle turbinate. 
The nasal septum is straight, and the inferior turbinates are within 
normal limits. IMPRESSION: Moderate mucosal thickening and partial 
opacification of the ethmoid sinuses. Mild to moderate mucosal 
thickening of the frontal, maxillary, and sphenoid sinuses. Small nasal 
polyp arising from the right middle turbinate.
