 SINUSESCLINICAL HISTORY: A 49-year-old male patient with recurrent 
episodes of sinusitis, now presenting with facial swelling and pain. 
COMPARISON: None available at the time of dictation. TECHNIQUE: A CT 
scan of the sinuses was performed following the administration of 60 mL 
of iopamidol __% injection IV contrast. The estimated radiation dose 
(CTDIvol [mGy]) for each series in this exam is __, and the estimated 
cumulative dose (DLP [mGy-cm]) is __.FINDINGS: The frontal sinuses are 
clear. The ethmoid sinuses exhibit mild mucosal thickening. The 
maxillary sinuses demonstrate complete opacification bilaterally, with 
air-fluid levels suggestive of acute sinusitis. The sphenoid sinuses 
reveal complete opacification, also suggestive of acute sinusitis. The 
nasal cavity displays a deviated septum to the left with compensatory 
hypertrophy of the right inferior turbinate. There is soft tissue 
swelling in the left premaxillary region, concerning for cellulitis. 
IMPRESSION: Complete opacification of the bilateral maxillary and 
sphenoid sinuses with air-fluid levels, indicative of acute sinusitis. 
Mild mucosal thickening of the ethmoid sinuses. Deviated septum to the 
left with compensatory hypertrophy of the right inferior turbinate. Soft
 tissue swelling in the left premaxillary region, concerning for 
cellulitis. Clinical correlation is advised.
