EXAM:
 MRI BRAIN W/O CONTRAST EXAM DATE: 03/22/2023 HISTORY: New onset 
headaches and visual disturbances. TECHNIQUE: Sagittal 3D T1-weighted 
MPRAGE images. Transaxial fast spin-echo T2-weighted images. Transaxial 
and coronal T2-weighted FLAIR images. Transaxial diffusion-weighted 
images. Transaxial susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI).FINDINGS: 
Ventricles are normal in size, and there is no evidence of midline 
shift. Cortical sulci are within normal limits. A well-circumscribed, 
round, T2-hyperintense lesion measuring approximately 2.2 x 2.4 cm is 
identified in the left temporal lobe, with surrounding vasogenic edema. 
No significant mass effect is seen. No diffusion restriction is 
identified within the lesion. No abnormal susceptibility artifacts are 
noted on SWI images to suggest hemorrhage. No other abnormal signal 
intensity within the brain parenchyma is observed. The visualized 
paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are unremarkable. No 
intraorbital abnormalities are seen. IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute 
infarct or hemorrhage. A T2-hyperintense lesion in the left temporal 
lobe with surrounding vasogenic edema, suggestive of a possible 
low-grade glioma or inflammatory lesion. Further evaluation with a 
contrast-enhanced MRI is recommended for better characterization. No 
significant cerebral atrophy or small vessel ischemic changes.
