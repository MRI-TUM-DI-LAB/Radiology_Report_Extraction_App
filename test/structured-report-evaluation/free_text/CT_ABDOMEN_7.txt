CT
 ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH CONTRASTCLINICAL HISTORY: Elevated liver 
enzymes and a history of alcohol abuseTECHNIQUE: Multiple axial and 
coronal CT images were obtained through the abdomen and pelvis after 
administration of intravenous contrast material. FINDINGS: The liver is 
diffusely enlarged with a nodular contour and heterogeneous attenuation,
 findings consistent with cirrhosis. No focal hepatic lesions are 
identified. Mild ascites is present in the peritoneal cavity. The 
intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ducts are not dilated. The 
gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, and adrenal glands are unremarkable. The 
spleen is enlarged, measuring 14 cm in craniocaudal dimension, 
suggestive of splenomegaly. There is no evidence of portal vein 
thrombosis. The kidneys demonstrate no hydronephrosis, and the ureters 
are unremarkable. The small and large bowel loops are normal, without 
obstruction, wall thickening, or dilatation. The urinary bladder is 
normal in contour, and the prostate gland is mildly enlarged with an 
estimated volume of 40 cc, consistent with benign prostatic hypertrophy.
 IMPRESSION: Cirrhosis with nodular liver contour and mild ascites. 
Splenomegaly, likely secondary to portal hypertension. Mildly enlarged 
prostate, likely representing benign prostatic hypertrophy.
