EXAM:
 MRI NECK WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRASTCLINICAL HISTORY: Male, 54 years of 
age, presenting with a three-month history of progressive dysphagia and 
left-sided neck mass. COMPARISON: __. TECHNIQUE: Contrast-enhanced CT of
 the neck was obtained in the axial plane after administration of 40 mL 
of IV contrast, with coronal and sagittal reformats. The estimated 
cumulative exposure (DLP mGy/cm) is 221. FINDINGS: The left maxillary 
sinus demonstrates mild mucosal thickening. The remainder of the 
paranasal sinuses, mastoid air cells, and middle ear cavities are clear.
 There are no lytic or blastic lesions in the bones. The cervical spine 
is unremarkable without fracture or malalignment. The lung apices are 
clear. Salivary glands and thyroid gland are normal. A well-defined, 
heterogeneously enhancing mass is identified in the left level II 
region, measuring approximately 3.5 x 2.6 x 3.1 cm. The mass is 
inseparable from the left sternocleidomastoid muscle and appears to 
exert mass effect on the adjacent internal jugular vein. No evidence of 
vascular invasion is noted. No calcification or necrosis is seen within 
the mass. No pathologic lymphadenopathy is identified in the remaining 
neck or supraclavicular regions. The arteries and veins of the neck are 
otherwise unremarkable. IMPRESSION: Heterogeneously enhancing left level
 II neck mass measuring approximately 3.5 x 2.6 x 3.1 cm, inseparable 
from the left sternocleidomastoid muscle, and causing mass effect on the
 adjacent internal jugular vein. Further evaluation with tissue sampling
 is recommended to establish a definitive diagnosis. Mild mucosal 
thickening in the left maxillary sinus. No pathologic lymphadenopathy in
 the neck or supraclavicular regions.
