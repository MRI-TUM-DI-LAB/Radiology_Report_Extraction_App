EXAM:
 MRI Left Knee Without Contrast Exam DATE: __ HISTORY: Patient presents 
with left knee pain. TECHNIQUE: Axial gradient-echo, coronal proton 
density, sagittal T1, proton density, and 3D Space images were obtained 
for evaluation. FINDINGS: The medial meniscus shows a horizontal tear at
 the junction of the body and posterior horn, while the lateral meniscus
 appears intact. There is no significant joint effusion observed. The 
anterior cruciate ligament and posterior cruciate ligament are intact. 
The medial and lateral collateral ligaments appear unremarkable. The 
extensor mechanism, including the patellar tendon and quadriceps tendon,
 is intact. There is mild cartilage thinning in the medial femoral 
condyle and medial tibial plateau. The articular cartilage in the 
lateral compartment and patellofemoral joint appears preserved. No 
significant bone marrow edema is observed. A small Baker's cyst is 
identified within the popliteal fossa. No other abnormal fluid 
collections are seen. IMPRESSION: Horizontal tear in the medial meniscus
 at the junction of the body and posterior horn. Mild cartilage thinning
 in the medial compartment of the left knee. Small Baker's cyst in the 
popliteal fossa. Intact cruciate and collateral ligaments. No 
significant joint effusion.
