 SINUSESCLINICAL HISTORY: A 52-year-old male patient with persistent 
sinus headaches and recent facial trauma. COMPARISON: None available at 
the time of dictation. TECHNIQUE: A CT scan of the sinuses was performed
 following the administration of 60 mL of iopamidol __% injection IV 
contrast. The estimated radiation dose (CTDIvol [mGy]) for each series 
in this exam is __, and the estimated cumulative dose (DLP [mGy-cm]) is 
__. FINDINGS: The frontal sinuses demonstrate mild mucosal thickening, 
without significant opacification. The ethmoid sinuses display 
near-complete opacification, suggestive of sinusitis. The maxillary 
sinuses reveal moderate mucosal thickening with partial opacification, 
and the left ostiomeatal complex appears obstructed. The sphenoid 
sinuses are clear. There is a minimally displaced fracture involving the
 left inferior orbital rim. The nasal septum appears deviated to the 
right, with hypertrophy of the bilateral inferior turbinates. 
IMPRESSION: Near-complete opacification of ethmoid sinuses, suggestive 
of sinusitis. Moderate mucosal thickening of maxillary sinuses with left
 ostiomeatal complex obstruction. Minimally displaced fracture of the 
left inferior orbital rim. Nasal septum deviation to the right and 
bilateral inferior turbinate hypertrophy.
