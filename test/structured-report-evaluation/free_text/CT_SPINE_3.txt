CT
 THORACIC SPINE WITHOUT CONTRASTCLINICAL HISTORY: A 65-year-old female 
with chronic back pain, evaluating for spinal pathology. COMPARISON: No 
comparison studies available. TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial CT images were
 obtained through the thoracic spine. Coronal and sagittal reformats 
were generated. The estimated radiation exposure is __ mGy per slice and
 __ mGy*cm cumulative dose. FINDINGS: The thoracic spine alignment is 
maintained. There is no evidence of acute fracture or subluxation. 
Vertebral body heights are preserved. The intervertebral disc spaces are
 well maintained. Mild degenerative changes are present at T7-T8 and 
T10-T11, with small osteophyte formation and mild facet joint 
arthropathy. No significant spinal canal or foraminal stenosis is 
identified. The prevertebral and paravertebral soft tissues appear 
normal. No significant lymphadenopathy or masses are seen. The 
visualized portions of the lung apices and mediastinum are unremarkable.
 IMPRESSION: Mild degenerative changes at T7-T8 and T10-T11, without 
significant spinal canal or foraminal stenosis. No evidence of acute 
fracture, subluxation, or significant spinal stenosis.
