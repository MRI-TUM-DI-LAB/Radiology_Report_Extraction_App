 KneeINDICATION: Right knee pain after sports injury.  COMPARISON: None.
  TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar and multi-sequence imaging of the right knee 
without intravenous contrast.  FINDINGS: Moderate bone marrow edema of 
the medial femoral condyle is noted. Subchondral cystic change of the 
medial tibial plateau is seen with surrounding focal bone marrow edema. 
The anterior cruciate ligament is intact but demonstrates mild 
thickening suggestive of a sprain. The posterior cruciate ligament is 
grossly intact. Mild signal alteration of the medial collateral ligament
 is noted, indicating a low-grade sprain. Major components of the 
lateral collateral ligament complex are grossly contiguous. Popliteus 
tendon appears unremarkable. Minor fraying of the posterior horn of the 
medial meniscus is seen, but no acute meniscal tear is identified. The 
lateral meniscus appears intact. Mild patellar and quadriceps tendinosis
 is noted. Grade II chondromalacia patella is present in the lateral 
facet. No pathological suprapatellar effusion is observed. A small 
amount of fluid is seen in the infrapatellar bursa. Minimal subcutaneous
 edema is noted in the prepatellar region. The pes anserine bursa shows a
 small amount of fluid, suggestive of bursitis.  IMPRESSION:  Grade II 
chondromalacia patella in the lateral facet. Subchondral cystic change 
of the medial tibial plateau with surrounding bone marrow edema, 
suggestive of early degenerative changes. Medial collateral ligament 
low-grade sprain. Anterior cruciate ligament sprain without a 
full-thickness tear. No acute meniscal tear. Mild patellar and 
quadriceps tendinosis. Small infrapatellar bursal fluid and prepatellar 
soft tissue edema. Pes anserine bursitis.
