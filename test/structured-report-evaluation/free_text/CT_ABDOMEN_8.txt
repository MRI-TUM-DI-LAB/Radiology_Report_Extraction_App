 ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH CONTRASTCLINICAL HISTORY: Chronic pelvic pain 
and dysmenorrhea.TECHNIQUE: Multiple axial and coronal CT images were 
obtained through the abdomen and pelvis after administration of 
intravenous contrast material. FINDINGS: The uterus is retroverted and 
demonstrates multiple nodular foci of low attenuation in the myometrium,
 consistent with adenomyosis. There is a 3.4 cm left ovarian cyst with 
thin septations, likely representing a benign hemorrhagic cyst. The 
liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, and adrenal glands are 
unremarkable. The intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ducts are not 
dilated. The kidneys demonstrate no hydronephrosis, and the ureters are 
unremarkable. The small and large bowel loops are normal, without 
obstruction, wall thickening, or dilatation. No free air or fluid is 
noted in the peritoneal cavity. The urinary bladder is normal in 
contour. IMPRESSION: Adenomyosis of the uterus. Left ovarian hemorrhagic
 cyst.
