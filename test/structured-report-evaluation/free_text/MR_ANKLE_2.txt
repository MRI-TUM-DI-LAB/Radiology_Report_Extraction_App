ANKLE
 MRI: MRI OF THE RIGHT ANKLE WITHOUT CONTRAST EXAM DATE: __ HISTORY: 
Right ankle pain and swelling. Suspected tarsal tunnel syndrome. 
COMPARISON: None available. TECHNIQUE: Axial, sagittal, and coronal 
T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and PD-FS images through the right ankle. 
Overall image quality is satisfactory. FINDINGS: No significant fluid 
collection or edema is noted around the tibial nerve within the tarsal 
tunnel. The tibial nerve demonstrates normal signal intensity and 
caliber. The flexor retinaculum appears intact. Mild joint effusion is 
seen in the tibiotalar joint. The articular cartilage and osseous 
structures, including the talus, are unremarkable. The peroneal, flexor,
 and extensor tendons appear normal in signal intensity, morphology, and
 course. The plantar fascia demonstrates normal thickness and signal 
intensity. No evidence of fracture or bone marrow edema is identified. 
The Achilles tendon demonstrates normal signal, course, and caliber 
without evidence of tendinopathy or tear. IMPRESSION: No significant 
fluid collection or edema around the tibial nerve within the tarsal 
tunnel, and the flexor retinaculum is intact. No MRI evidence of tarsal 
tunnel syndrome. Mild tibiotalar joint effusion. Normal appearance of 
the tendons and plantar fascia in the right ankle. No evidence of 
fracture or bone marrow edema.
