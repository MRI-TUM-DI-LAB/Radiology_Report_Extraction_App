MRI
 BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST: __ CLINICAL HISTORY: 55-year-old woman
 with a history of migraines, now presenting with worsening headaches 
and recent onset of blurred vision. COMPARISON: MRI brain on __. 
TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar, multisequence MRI of the brain was obtained, 
including the following sequences: T1, T2, FLAIR, GRE, diffusion, and 
dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) perfusion. 10 mL of Gadavist 
contrast was administered intravenously, and then postcontrast images of
 the brain were obtained. FINDINGS: MRI BRAIN: A 1.5 cm enhancing mass 
is seen in the right temporal lobe, surrounded by mild vasogenic edema. 
No significant mass effect is observed. The mass is new compared to the 
prior study. There is no evidence of hemorrhage or acute infarct. 
Ventricles and sulci appear normal. Bones and soft tissues are 
unremarkable. Normal flow voids are seen within the major intracranial 
vessels. DSC PERFUSION: Increased perfusion is noted within the 
enhancing mass in the right temporal lobe. IMPRESSION: New enhancing 
mass in the right temporal lobe with surrounding vasogenic edema and 
increased perfusion, suspicious for a neoplasm. Further evaluation, 
including a dedicated contrast-enhanced brain MRI and potential biopsy, 
is recommended. No other significant intracranial abnormalities 
identified. SUMMARY: New enhancing mass in the right temporal lobe 
suggestive of a neoplasm. Further evaluation is recommended.
