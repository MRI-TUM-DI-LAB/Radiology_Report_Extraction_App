45-
year-old female presenting with left shoulder pain and stiffness, 
suspecting adhesive capsulitis.COMPARISON: Radiographs of the right 
shoulder dated __. PROCEDURE: On a 3T magnet, the following MR sequences
 were obtained of the right shoulder: three-plane localizer, coronal T1,
 coronal T2 with fat saturation, sagittal T1, sagittal T2 with fat 
saturation, axial PD with fat saturation through the labrum.FINDINGS: 
The acromioclavicular joint shows mild degenerative changes without 
significant mass effect on the subacromial space. The coracoacromial 
ligament appears normal. No significant subacromial/subdeltoid bursitis 
or glenohumeral joint effusion is observed. Rotator cuff tendons appear 
intact without evidence of tear or significant tendinopathy. The biceps 
tendon is normal, and the labrum appears grossly intact. No significant 
chondral wear or osteoarthritic changes are seen in the glenohumeral 
joint. There is a moderate thickening of the joint capsule and synovium,
 which is consistent with the clinical suspicion of adhesive capsulitis 
(frozen shoulder). The axillary recess demonstrates a mild fluid 
collection, likely due to synovial inflammation.IMPRESSION: MRI findings
 are consistent with adhesive capsulitis, also known as frozen shoulder.
 There is no evidence of rotator cuff tear or significant glenohumeral 
joint osteoarthritis.
