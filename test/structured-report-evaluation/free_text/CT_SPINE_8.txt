CT
 THORACIC SPINE WITHOUT CONTRASTCLINICAL HISTORY: A 64-year-old male 
with mid-back pain and history of osteoporosis. COMPARISON: No 
comparison studies available. TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial CT images were
 obtained through the thoracic spine. Coronal and sagittal reformats 
were produced. The estimated radiation exposure is __ mGy per slice and 
__ mGy*cm cumulative dose. FINDINGS: The thoracic spine alignment is 
maintained. Vertebral body heights are preserved except for a mild 
compression fracture at T9, consistent with the patient's history of 
osteoporosis. The intervertebral disc spaces are maintained. There is 
mild multilevel degenerative disc disease and facet joint hypertrophy, 
without significant spinal canal or foraminal stenosis. The remaining 
thoracic discs and facet joints show no significant abnormalities. The 
prevertebral and paravertebral soft tissues appear normal. The 
visualized portions of the lung parenchyma and mediastinum are 
unremarkable. IMPRESSION: Mild compression fracture at T9 consistent 
with osteoporosis. Mild multilevel degenerative disc disease and facet 
joint hypertrophy without significant spinal canal or foraminal 
stenosis. No evidence of acute fracture, subluxation, or significant 
spinal stenosis.
