EXAM:
 MRI RIGHT WRIST WITHOUT CONTRAST EXAM DATE: __ CLINICAL HISTORY: Right 
wrist pain. COMPARISON: None available. TECHNIQUE: MRI of the right 
wrist was performed using 1.5 Tesla magnet. Multiplanar proton density, 
T1-weighted, and T2-weighted fat-suppressed sequences were obtained. 
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of fracture, dislocation, or abnormal 
bone marrow signal. The alignment of the carpal bones is normal. No 
significant ulnar variance is observed. The triangular fibrocartilage 
complex is intact, as are the scapholunate and lunotriquetral ligaments.
 The extensor and flexor tendons appear normal. A focal area of 
increased signal intensity is noted within the proximal aspect of the 
scaphoid bone, consistent with a bone contusion. Mild tenosynovitis is 
seen involving the extensor carpi ulnaris tendon sheath, likely 
secondary to overuse or strain. No joint effusion or ganglion cysts are 
identified. The surrounding soft tissues appear unremarkable. 
IMPRESSION: Bone contusion in the proximal aspect of the scaphoid bone. 
Mild tenosynovitis involving the extensor carpi ulnaris tendon sheath. 
No evidence of fracture, dislocation, or significant ligamentous injury.
