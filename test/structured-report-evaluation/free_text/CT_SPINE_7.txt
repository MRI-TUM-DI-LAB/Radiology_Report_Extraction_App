CT
 CERVICAL SPINE WITHOUT CONTRASTCLINICAL HISTORY: A 45-year-old female 
with neck pain and right arm numbness. COMPARISON: No comparison studies
 available. TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial CT images were obtained through 
the cervical spine. Coronal and sagittal reformats were produced. The 
estimated radiation exposure is __ mGy per slice and __ mGy*cm 
cumulative dose. FINDINGS: The cervical spine alignment is maintained. 
There is no evidence of acute fracture or subluxation. Vertebral body 
heights are preserved. The intervertebral disc spaces are well 
maintained, except for mild disc space narrowing at C5-C6 level. At 
C5-C6, there is a moderate right paracentral disc protrusion with mild 
facet joint hypertrophy, leading to moderate right foraminal stenosis 
and mild central canal stenosis. The remaining cervical discs show no 
significant abnormalities. The facet joints are unremarkable. The 
prevertebral and paravertebral soft tissues appear normal. The 
visualized portions of the lung apices and mediastinum are unremarkable.
 IMPRESSION: Moderate right paracentral disc protrusion at C5-C6, with 
mild central canal stenosis and moderate right foraminal stenosis. Mild 
degenerative disc space narrowing at C5-C6 level. No evidence of acute 
fracture, subluxation, or significant spinal stenosis.
