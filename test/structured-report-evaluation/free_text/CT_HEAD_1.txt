 HEAD WITHOUT CONTRASTCLINICAL HISTORY: A 69-year-old female with left 
gaze deviation and suspected new seizure or stroke. COMPARISON: __ 
non-contrast head CT study. TECHNIQUE: Sequential axial CT images taken 
from the skull base to the level of the vertex without the intravenous 
administration of contrast. FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute 
intracranial hemorrhage or significant mass effect. Ventricles and sulci
 are appropriate for the patient's stated age. No midline shift is 
noted. The gray-white matter differentiation is preserved. There are new
 focal calcifications in the right frontal lobe and anterior right 
parietal lobe (series 2, image #28 and #29, respectively). These 
findings are nonspecific and may represent small calcified granulomas, 
but they are not typical for neurocysticercosis. The visualized portions
 of the orbits appear normal. There is mucosal thickening within the 
bilateral sphenoid sinuses. Left middle ear effusion is present. A soft 
tissue density is seen within the bony right external auditory canal, 
which may represent cerumen. IMPRESSION: New focal calcifications in the
 right frontal lobe and anterior right parietal lobe, with uncertain 
etiology and clinical significance. Findings are nonspecific, and 
although neurocysticercosis could be considered, these calcifications 
are not typical. Left middle ear effusion. Soft tissue density within 
the bony right external auditory canal, which may represent cerumen. 
Given the clinical history of left gaze deviation and suspected new 
seizure or stroke, further evaluation with MRI may be helpful to rule 
out underlying ischemic or inflammatory changes that may not be apparent
 on non-contrast CT
