HISTORY:
 Patient presenting with right shoulder pain and limited range of 
motion, with a suspicion of rotator cuff tear. COMPARISON: No prior 
studies are available for comparison. TECHNIQUE: A 3T MRI of the right 
shoulder was performed, including axial, coronal, and sagittal sequences
 with proton density fat saturation, and T1- and T2-weighted 
images.FINDINGS: Moderate degenerative changes in the acromioclavicular 
joint, with mild joint space narrowing and osteophyte formation. There 
is a presence of fluid within the subacromial/subdeltoid bursa, 
suggestive of bursitis, along with a small glenohumeral joint effusion. A
 full-thickness tear of the supraspinatus tendon, approximately 1.5 cm 
in size, is observed, with tendon retraction measuring up to 1.2 cm. The
 infraspinatus tendon shows mild tendinopathy and bursal-sided fraying, 
without a full-thickness tear. The subscapularis and teres minor tendons
 appear intact. The long head of the biceps tendon is subluxed, with 
associated intra-articular tendinopathy, while the biceps anchor remains
 intact. A small superior labral tear is present. Mild chondromalacia is
 observed in the glenohumeral joint, with focal thinning of the 
articular cartilage over the humeral head and glenoid. No significant 
bone marrow edema or osseous lesions are detected. IMPRESSION: 
Full-thickness tear of the supraspinatus tendon with 1.2 cm of tendon 
retraction, mild tendinopathy and bursal-sided fraying of the 
infraspinatus tendon, moderate subacromial/subdeltoid bursitis, small 
glenohumeral joint effusion, subluxed and tendinopathic long head of the
 biceps tendon, a small superior labral tear, and mild chondromalacia in
 the glenohumeral joint.
