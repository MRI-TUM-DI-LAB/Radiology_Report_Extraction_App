EXAM:
 MRI NECK WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST EXAM DATE: __CLINICAL INDICATION: 
Difficulty swallowing for the past 3 months. Comparison: No previous 
studies available for comparison. Technique: MRI of the neck was 
conducted using the following sequences: Sagittal STIR, axial and 
sagittal T1 with fat saturation, axial, sagittal, and coronal T1, axial 
T2, and post-gadolinium axial, coronal, sagittal T1 with fat saturation 
after intravenous administration of 20 mL of Omniscan. FINDINGS: A 1.5 
cm enhancing mass is observed in the left oropharynx, suggestive of a 
neoplastic lesion. No other masses or focal abnormalities are detected 
in the neck. No instances of vascular narrowing are observed. There are 
several enlarged lymph nodes on the left side of the neck, the largest 
measuring 1.3 cm. The vascular flow voids appear normal. The bones and 
soft tissues exhibit normal appearances, apart from the aforementioned 
findings. IMPRESSION: A 1.5 cm enhancing mass in the left oropharynx, 
suspicious for neoplastic involvement. Further evaluation with a biopsy 
is recommended. Enlarged lymph nodes on the left side of the neck, 
possibly related to the oropharyngeal mass. Correlation with clinical 
findings is advised.
