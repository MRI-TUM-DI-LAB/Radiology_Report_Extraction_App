CT
 HEAD WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRASTCLINICAL HISTORY: A 45-year-old male 
presenting with dizziness, vertigo, and ataxia for the past three weeks.
 COMPARISON: None available. TECHNIQUE: Sequential axial CT images were 
acquired from the skull base to the vertex before and after intravenous 
administration of 100 mL of Isovue 300 contrast agent. FINDINGS: There 
is a well-circumscribed, homogenously enhancing mass in the left 
cerebellopontine angle measuring approximately 2.5 x 2.2 cm. The mass is
 exerting mass effect on the adjacent cerebellar hemisphere and 
brainstem without causing significant midline shift or hydrocephalus. 
The mass appears to arise from the internal auditory canal, suggesting a
 vestibular schwannoma. The cerebral parenchyma demonstrates no evidence
 of acute infarction, intracranial hemorrhage, or extraaxial fluid 
collections. The ventricular system is normal in size and configuration.
 Gray-white matter differentiation is preserved. Visualized portions of 
the orbits and paranasal sinuses appear unremarkable. No significant 
mastoid air cell opacification is noted. IMPRESSION: Left 
cerebellopontine angle enhancing mass measuring 2.5 x 2.2 cm, with mass 
effect on the adjacent cerebellar hemisphere and brainstem. The lesion 
is most consistent with a vestibular schwannoma (acoustic neuroma) given
 its location and enhancement pattern. No acute intracranial 
abnormalities or significant sinus or mastoid disease
