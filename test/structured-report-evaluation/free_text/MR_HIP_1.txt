MRI
 HIP: __. CLINICAL HISTORY: 55-year-old man with left hip pain and 
decreased range of motion, assessing for labral tear or osteoarthritis. 
COMPARISON: None available. PROCEDURE: Multiplanar, multisequence 
imaging of the left hip was performed at 3T without contrast. FINDINGS: 
There is a small joint effusion within the left hip. Cartilage, bones, 
and marrow: Mild degenerative changes are present in the left hip joint,
 with mild chondral thinning and subchondral cystic changes in the 
femoral head and acetabulum. No evidence of avascular necrosis or acute 
fracture. The bone marrow signal is unremarkable. A mild degenerative 
superior labral tear is identified, with adjacent mild chondral 
thinning. The iliopsoas, gluteus medius, gluteus minimus, and hamstring 
tendons are intact. No significant peritendinous edema or bursitis is 
observed. Unremarkable pelvic organs. No additional findings.  
IMPRESSION: Mild degenerative changes in the left hip joint, with mild 
chondral thinning and subchondral cystic changes in the femoral head and
 acetabulum. Mild degenerative superior labral tear with adjacent mild 
chondral thinning. Small left hip joint effusion. Intact iliopsoas, 
gluteus medius, gluteus minimus, and hamstring tendons without 
significant peritendinous edema or bursitis.
