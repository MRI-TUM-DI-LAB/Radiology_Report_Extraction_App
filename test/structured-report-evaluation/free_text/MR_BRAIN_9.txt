EXAM:
 MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST EXAM DATE: __ CONTRAST INDICATION: 
Recurrent headaches and recent episodes of dizziness. COMPARISON: None 
available. TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar, multisequence MRI of the brain was 
performed at 3 Tesla, including axial T1-weighted, axial T2-weighted, 
axial T2-weighted FLAIR, axial diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and 
axial susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI). Post-contrast axial, 
sagittal, and coronal T1-weighted images were obtained after intravenous
 administration of gadolinium. FINDINGS: There is a small, 
well-circumscribed lesion in the left cerebellar hemisphere 
demonstrating T2 hyperintensity and faint peripheral enhancement on 
post-contrast images. This lesion measures approximately 1.2 x 1.0 cm. 
No surrounding edema or mass effect is noted. The lesion's appearance is
 suggestive of a small hemangioblastoma, but other possibilities such as
 a low-grade glioma cannot be excluded. The ventricular system is normal
 in size and configuration. The cerebral parenchyma is unremarkable, 
with no evidence of acute ischemia, hemorrhage, or abnormal enhancement.
 White matter shows no significant T2 or FLAIR hyperintensities. The 
paranasal sinuses, mastoid air cells, and orbits are clear. Normal flow 
voids are visualized within the major intracranial vessels. IMPRESSION: 
Small enhancing lesion in the left cerebellar hemisphere with imaging 
features suggestive of a hemangioblastoma, although a low-grade glioma 
cannot be excluded. Further evaluation with follow-up imaging or 
neurosurgical consultation may be warranted. No acute intracranial 
findings or significant white matter changes.
