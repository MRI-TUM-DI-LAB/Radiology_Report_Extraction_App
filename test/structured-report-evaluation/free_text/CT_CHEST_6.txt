EXAM:
 CTA CHEST EXAM DATE: __.HISTORY: 52-year-old female with shortness of 
breath and chest pain. COMPARISON: None.TECHNIQUE: Volumetric scanning 
was performed of the chest using 3 mm of collimation at 3 mm intervals 
after administering 100 mL of nonionic Ultravist 370 contrast. Coronal 
2D reconstructions concentrating on the pulmonary arteries were also 
performed. FINDINGS: The pulmonary arteries demonstrate a filling defect
 in the right lower lobe segmental branch, consistent with a pulmonary 
embolism. No additional filling defects are identified in the remaining 
pulmonary vasculature. The thoracic aorta is unremarkable without 
aneurysmal dilatation or dissection. Mild bronchial wall thickening is 
present in the left lower lobe, likely due to bronchitis. The lung 
parenchyma is otherwise clear, with no nodules, masses, or significant 
infiltrates identified. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is observed.
 The heart, pericardium, great vessels, and mediastinum appear normal. 
No significant mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy is detected. The 
tracheobronchial tree is patent and unremarkable. Limited evaluation of 
the upper abdomen reveals no significant abnormalities. IMPRESSION: 
Pulmonary embolism in the right lower lobe segmental branch. Immediate 
clinical attention and management are recommended. Mild bronchial wall 
thickening in the left lower lobe, likely representing bronchitis. 
Unremarkable thoracic aorta without aneurysmal dilatation or dissection.
 No significant mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. No pleural 
effusion or pneumothorax detected.
