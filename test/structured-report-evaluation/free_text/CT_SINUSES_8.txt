 SINUSESCLINICAL HISTORY: A 60-year-old male patient with severe sinus 
pain and nasal congestion. COMPARISON: None available at the time of 
dictation. TECHNIQUE: A CT scan of the sinuses was performed following 
the administration of 60 mL of iopamidol __% injection IV contrast. The 
estimated radiation dose (CTDIvol [mGy]) for each series in this exam is
 __, and the estimated cumulative dose (DLP [mGy-cm]) is __. FINDINGS: 
The frontal sinuses are clear. The ethmoid sinuses display mild mucosal 
thickening. The maxillary sinuses demonstrate complete opacification 
with air-fluid levels, suggestive of acute sinusitis. The sphenoid 
sinuses are clear. A large mucocele is identified in the left maxillary 
sinus, causing remodeling of the surrounding bony walls. The nasal 
septum appears midline, with no significant deviation. The inferior 
turbinates are unremarkable. IMPRESSION: Complete opacification of 
maxillary sinuses with air-fluid levels, suggestive of acute sinusitis. 
Large mucocele in the left maxillary sinus causing bony remodeling. Mild
 mucosal thickening of the ethmoid sinuses.
