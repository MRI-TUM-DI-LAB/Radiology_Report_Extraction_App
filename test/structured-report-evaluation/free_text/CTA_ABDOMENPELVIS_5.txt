 ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH CONTRASTCLINICAL HISTORY: Recent abdominal pain
 and unintentional weight lossTECHNIQUE: Multiple axial and coronal CT 
images were obtained through the abdomen and pelvis after administration
 of intravenous contrast material. FINDINGS: The liver demonstrates a 
4.5 x 3.8 cm hypodense mass in segment VIII with peripheral contrast 
enhancement suggestive of a hepatic hemangioma. The intrahepatic and 
extrahepatic biliary ducts are not dilated. The gallbladder, pancreas, 
spleen, and adrenal glands are unremarkable. Multiple small mesenteric 
lymph nodes measuring up to 1.5 cm in the short axis are identified, 
likely representing reactive lymphadenopathy. The kidneys demonstrate no
 hydronephrosis, and the ureters are unremarkable. The small and large 
bowel loops are normal, without obstruction, wall thickening, or 
dilatation. No free air or fluid is noted in the peritoneal cavity. The 
urinary bladder is normal in contour, and the prostate gland is mildly 
enlarged with an estimated volume of 35 cc, consistent with benign 
prostatic hypertrophy. IMPRESSION: Hepatic hemangioma in segment VIII of
 the liver. Reactive mesenteric lymphadenopathy. Mildly enlarged 
prostate, likely representing benign prostatic hypertrophy.
