HISTORY:
 A 17-year-old female presents with persistent pain in the left knee and
 a history of a previous knee strain. COMPARISON: Left knee radiograph 
dated __. PROCEDURE: A multiplanar, multisequence MRI of the left knee 
was performed without contrast. FINDINGS: Mild bone marrow edema is 
observed in the posterior aspect of the medial femoral condyle. The 
physes appear closed. No abnormalities or defects are seen in the 
articular cartilage. The medial meniscus demonstrates a small radial 
tear in the posterior horn. The lateral meniscus appears normal. Both 
the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments are intact and exhibit 
normal signal intensity. The medial and lateral collateral ligamentous 
complexes are also intact and show normal signal intensity. The 
patellofemoral extensor mechanism reveals a slight patellar tilt, but no
 significant malalignment. The femoral trochlear groove and cartilage 
appear normal, as do the medial patellofemoral ligament and retinaculum.
 The patellar and quadriceps tendons show normal signal intensity. A 
physiological amount of fluid is present within the knee joint, and no 
intraarticular body is identified. The surrounding muscles and soft 
tissues appear normal. IMPRESSION: A small radial tear in the posterior 
horn of the medial meniscus, mild bone marrow edema in the posterior 
aspect of the medial femoral condyle, and a slight patellar tilt. 
Overall, the findings suggest a mild knee injury with no significant 
structural damage.
