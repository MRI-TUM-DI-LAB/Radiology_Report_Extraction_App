INDICATIONS:
 The patient experienced a fall two weeks ago and now reports persistent
 pain and numbness since the incident.COMPARISON: None.TECHNIQUE: Wrist 
imaging using multiplanar and multisequence approaches without 
intravenous contrast.FINDINGS: The medial aspect of the wrist is marked.
 No acute osseous fractures are observed. Mild degenerative arthrosis is
 present in the wrist joints with minimal subchondral cystic changes. 
The scaphoid bone shows a non-displaced fracture. The lunotriquetral 
joint space is preserved. The scapholunate ligament is partially torn. 
The extensor carpi ulnaris tendon appears normal, while the flexor 
tendons show mild tenosynovitis. A small joint effusion is present in 
the radiocarpal joint. A 5 x 4 x 8 mm cystic structure is located palmar
 to the radiocarpal joint, likely representing a synovial cyst. No 
significant soft tissue mass is detected. The median and ulnar nerves 
appear unremarkable, and the carpal tunnel is intact. Mild 
osteoarthritic changes are noted in the third carpometacarpal joint with
 joint space narrowing and small marginal 
osteophytes.IMPRESSION:Non-displaced scaphoid fracture.Partial tear of 
the scapholunate ligament.Mild tenosynovitis of the flexor tendons.Small
 joint effusion in the radiocarpal joint with a synovial cyst palmar to 
the joint.Mild osteoarthritic changes in the third carpometacarpal 
joint.
