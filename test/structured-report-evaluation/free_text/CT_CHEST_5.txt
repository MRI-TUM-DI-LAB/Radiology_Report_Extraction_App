EXAM:
  CHEST W/CONTRAST CT EXAM DATE: __.HISTORY: Recurrent cough and fever 
TECHNIQUE: 100 mL Ultravist 370. Volumetric evaluation of the chest. 
Axial and coronal CT angiographic images. FINDINGS: A 1.2 cm 
consolidative lesion is noted in the right middle lobe, suggestive of 
pneumonia. The lung parenchyma is otherwise unremarkable, with no 
nodules, masses, or areas of atelectasis detected. The tracheobronchial 
tree appears patent. Mild hilar and subcarinal lymphadenopathy are 
present, with the largest lymph node measuring 1.1 cm in short-axis 
diameter. No significant mediastinal lymphadenopathy is identified. The 
heart and pericardium appear normal, with no signs of pericardial 
effusion. Calcification of the coronary arteries is noted. The thoracic 
aorta is unremarkable, without aneurysm or dissection. The upper abdomen
 shows normal-appearing liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and 
kidneys. No significant abnormalities are detected. There is no evidence
 of pleural or pericardial effusion or pneumothorax. The visualized 
osseous structures are intact, and the soft tissues appear within normal
 limits. IMPRESSION: A consolidative lesion in the right middle lobe, 
suggestive of pneumonia. Clinical correlation and appropriate treatment 
are advised. Mild hilar and subcarinal lymphadenopathy. Calcification of
 the coronary arteries. No pleural or pericardial effusion or 
pneumothorax detected. Unremarkable upper abdominal structures.
