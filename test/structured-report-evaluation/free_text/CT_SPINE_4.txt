 LUMBAR SPINE WITHOUT CONTRASTCLINICAL HISTORY: A 45-year-old male with 
lower back pain and radiculopathy.COMPARISON: No comparison studies 
available. TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial CT images were obtained through 
the lumbar spine. Coronal and sagittal reformats were obtained. The 
estimated radiation exposure is __ mGy per slice and __ mGy*cm 
cumulative dose. FINDINGS: The lumbar spine alignment is maintained. 
There is no evidence of acute fracture or subluxation. Vertebral body 
heights are preserved. The intervertebral disc spaces are well 
maintained. Moderate degenerative changes are noted at L4-L5, with disc 
space narrowing, osteophyte formation, and facet joint hypertrophy. 
There is moderate spinal canal stenosis and moderate bilateral foraminal
 narrowing at this level. Mild degenerative changes are seen at L3-L4 
and L5-S1, without significant spinal canal or foraminal stenosis. The 
paraspinal soft tissues appear normal. The visualized portions of the 
abdominal aorta and adjacent organs are unremarkable. IMPRESSION: 
Moderate degenerative changes at L4-L5 with spinal canal stenosis and 
moderate bilateral foraminal narrowing. Mild degenerative changes at 
L3-L4 and L5-S1, without significant spinal canal or foraminal stenosis.
 No evidence of acute fracture or subluxation.
