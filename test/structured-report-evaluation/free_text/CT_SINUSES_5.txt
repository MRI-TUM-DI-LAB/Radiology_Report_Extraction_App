 SINUSCLINICAL HISTORY: A 65-year-old male patient with a history of 
chronic sinusitis, presenting with worsening sinus pain and increased 
nasal discharge. COMPARISON: ()TECHNIQUE: CT of the paranasal sinuses 
was performed before and after administration of __ mL Ultravist 370 IV 
contrast.FINDINGS: The paranasal sinuses demonstrate complete 
opacification of the left maxillary sinus and partial opacification of 
the right maxillary sinus, suggestive of sinusitis. The ethmoid air 
cells show moderate mucosal thickening bilaterally. The sphenoid sinus 
exhibits complete opacification, while the frontal sinuses reveal mild 
mucosal thickening. The nasal cavity displays moderate septal deviation 
to the right with associated inferior turbinate hypertrophy, 
contributing to mild right nasal passage narrowing. There is no evidence
 of bony erosion or destruction. IMPRESSION: Bilateral maxillary 
sinusitis, complete opacification on the left side and partial 
opacification on the right side. Moderate bilateral ethmoid sinus 
mucosal thickening. Complete opacification of the sphenoid sinus. Mild 
frontal sinus mucosal thickening. Moderate septal deviation to the right
 with associated inferior turbinate hypertrophy.
