EXAM:
 MRI LEFT WRIST WITHOUT CONTRAST EXAM DATE: __ CLINICAL HISTORY: 
24-year-old female, history of a fall on the outstretched left hand on 
12/03/2022, with subsequent left wrist pain and swelling. COMPARISON: 
Left wrist radiographs __ PROCEDURE COMMENTS: Multiplanar, multisequence
 imaging of the left wrist was performed at 3T without 
contrast.FINDINGS: The MRI reveals a mild effusion in the radiocarpal 
and midcarpal joints. A linear low signal intensity is observed 
traversing the waist of the scaphoid bone, consistent with an acute 
nondisplaced scaphoid fracture. Associated marrow edema is also present.
 There are no additional fractures or bone contusions identified. The 
scapholunate and lunotriquetral ligaments appear intact, and the carpal 
bones demonstrate normal alignment. The triangular fibrocartilage 
complex (TFCC) is intact, with no evidence of tears or degeneration. The
 ulnar attachments of the peripheral TFCC are preserved, and both the 
foveal attachment and the central articular disc are intact. No 
significant tenosynovitis or tendon tears are noted in the flexor or 
extensor compartments. The carpal tunnel and median nerve appear 
unremarkable. IMPRESSION: Acute nondisplaced scaphoid fracture with 
associated marrow edema. Mild effusion in the radiocarpal and midcarpal 
joints. Intact scapholunate and lunotriquetral ligaments and normal 
carpal bone alignment. Preserved triangular fibrocartilage complex with 
no tears or degeneration.
