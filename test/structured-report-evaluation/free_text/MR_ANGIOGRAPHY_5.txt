MRA
 Abdomen and Pelvis: __.CLINICAL HISTORY: 48-year-old female, kidney 
transplant evaluation. Assess abdominal and pelvic vessels for patency. 
COMPARISON: None. TECHNIQUE: MR angiography of the abdomen and pelvis 
was performed before and after the administration of 5.8 ml Gadovist. 3D
 reformations consisting of curved and multiplanar reformations, maximum
 intensity projections.FINDINGS: Vasculature: The hepatic vasculature, 
splenic vein, celiac artery, superior mesenteric artery (SMA), and 
inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) appear normal. The abdominal aorta 
demonstrates focal stenosis at the level of the renal arteries, with a 
60% luminal narrowing on the left side and 50% on the right side. The 
aorta measures 0.6 x 0.7 cm just above the bifurcation. The internal and
 external iliac veins appear normal. The inferior vena cava (IVC) is 
normal. Abdomen: Normal liver, gallbladder, adrenal glands, spleen, and 
pancreas. The right kidney appears to be atrophic and displays abnormal 
enhancement. The left kidney shows multicystic alterations, which align 
with the patient's history of multicystic dysplastic kidney. Bowel 
structures appear normal. In the pelvis, the urinary bladder seems 
unremarkable. There are no notable musculoskeletal abnormalities. 
IMPRESSION: Focal stenosis of the abdominal aorta at the level of the 
renal arteries, with 60% luminal narrowing on the left side and 50% on 
the right side. Further evaluation may be warranted. Atrophic right 
kidney with abnormal enhancement and multicystic dysplastic left kidney.
