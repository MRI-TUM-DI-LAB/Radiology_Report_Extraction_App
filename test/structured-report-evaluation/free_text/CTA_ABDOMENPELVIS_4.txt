 ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST, LOW DOSE: CLINICAL BACKGROUND: A 
38-year-old individual reports occasional episodes of abdominal 
discomfort and pain. COMPARATIVE STUDY: Not available. TECHNIQUE: The 
abdomen and pelvis underwent an unenhanced low dose CT scan, with no use
 of intravenous or oral contrast agents. OBSERVATIONS: No remarkable 
findings are identified in the lower thoracic region, liver, biliary 
system, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, or reproductive structures. 
The gastrointestinal tract does not display any dilation, and there is 
no evidence of thickened bowel walls or abnormal appendix. Neither free 
fluid nor air is detected within the peritoneal space. There is a subtle
 distal left periureteral fat stranding. The blood vessels appear 
typical, with no noteworthy irregularities. No swollen lymph nodes are 
seen. A single 3 mm stone is located in the posterior urinary bladder 
wall's dependent portion. No concerning findings or anomalies are 
observed in the bones and soft tissues. CONCLUSION: Absence of ureteral 
stones or hydronephrosis. The presence of a 3 mm stone in the urinary 
bladder and mild periureteral fat stranding on the left side may suggest
 a kidney stone that has recently passed.
