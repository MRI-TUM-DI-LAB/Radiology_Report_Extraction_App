CT
 CERVICAL SPINE WITHOUT CONTRASTCLINICAL HISTORY: A seven-year-old 
female with achondroplasia and known hydrocephalus fell from a 
wheelchair. COMPARISON: No comparison studies available. TECHNIQUE: 
Multiple contiguous axial CT images were obtained through the cervical 
spine. Coronal and sagittal reformats were obtained. The estimated 
radiation exposure is __ mGy per slice and __ mGy*cm cumulative dose. 
FINDINGS: There is widening observed at the posterior articulation 
between the bilateral occipital condyles and the lateral masses of C1. 
This finding raises concern for distraction or subluxation at this 
level. The remaining vertebral bodies of the cervical spine appear 
dysmorphic and somewhat elongated in the superior to inferior dimension.
 Sclerosis at the C5/6 level, which may be degenerative, is noted. No 
other evidence of acute fracture or malalignment is present. 
Incidentally, a left pleural effusion is identified. An endotracheal 
tube and a nasogastric tube are in place. IMPRESSION: Widening at the 
posterior articulation between the occipital condyle and lateral masses 
of C1 bilaterally, concerning for distraction or subluxation. Please 
refer to the same-day MRI of the cervical spine for additional details. 
No additional evidence of acute fracture or vertebral column 
subluxation. Left pleural effusion.
